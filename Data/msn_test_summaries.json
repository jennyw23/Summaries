        "text": "© Getty Images GettyImages-1254694766.jpg  So far, Governor Ron DeSantis has yet to actually announce his candidacy for president, despite the fact he all but certainly will jump in the ring. But his decision to wait until the conclusion of Florida’s legislative session and to not directly attack former president Donald Trump has made him uniquely vulnerable to the former president’s barbs.  This weekend, Mr DeSantis caught a break when he and Mr Trump both happened to be in Iowa and the former president’s event got rained out. This gave Mr DeSantis, a politician notorious for his poor retail politics skills, to press the flesh unfettered by the spectre of the former president.  But Mr DeSantis took two kicks to the chin on Tuesday evening. First in Jacksonville, the 12th largest city in America, Mr DeSantis had endorsed the Republican candidate Daniel Davis for mayor.  Jacksonville was the largest city in the United States with a Republican mayor. But Democrat Donna Deegan beat back Mr Davis and will become the city’s first female mayor.  Meanwhile, in Kentucky, Mr DeSantis and Mr Trump engaged in a proxy war in the GOP gubernatorial primary. Mr Trump had endorsed Attorney General Daniel Cameron. This came despite the fact that Mr Cameron is a known protege of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom Mr Trump despises but who keeps an iron grip on the state party. Mr DeSantis, for his part, endorsed Mr Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft in the primary.  Ultimately, Mr Cameron prevailed and Mr Trump could not help but gloat on Truth Social, calling the governor “DeSanctimonious” and saying “The DeSanctimonious backed candidate came in a DISTANT third. Ron’s magic is GONE!” Mr Trump also noted that “DeSanctimonious lost Jacksonville and Kentucky last night. Not good!!!”  Of course, endorsements alone do not determine election results, and multiple factors played into the results in Jacksonville and Kentucky – they are both off-year elections with significantly low turnout. But Mr DeSantis still chose to get involved in both races to flex his political clout, and now he has little to show for it.  Polling has shown that Mr DeSantis has taken a steep tumble ever since his resounding double-digit re-election campaign in November. And when Mr DeSantis has tried to even subtly attack the former president, as he tried doing before Mr Trump’s arrest in relation to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, he has faced the MAGA wrath.  Not only that, but even when Mr DeSantis’ surrogates try to hit back at the former president, it does Mr DeSantis more harm than good. Last week, during Mr Trump’s CNN town hall, Never Back Down, a Super PAC that supports Mr DeSantis, put out a tweet deriding Mr Trump. But Semafor reported that the super PAC now regrets putting out the tweet, with one person calling it a “massive mistake.”  Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis are also now engaged in a war of words on abortion, with Mr Trump hitting Mr DeSantis for signing a six-week abortion ban. He told newly launched outlet The Messenger, “Many people within the pro-life movement feel that that was too harsh,” while Mr DeSantis said “Protecting an unborn child when there’s a detectable heartbeat is something that almost 99% of pro-lifers support.”  All of this comes before Mr DeSantis has even thrown his hat in the race. But he risks being significantly weakened right out of the gate, with his best hope riding on the possibility that Mr Trump will implode.

Dramatic cellphone footage taken during class Friday at Antioch High School captured the rambunctious student confronting her teacher after her phone was taken away as a disciplinary action. The disobedient student had been “texting and Googling answers for her school work,” according to Reddit user @Lazy_Mouse3803, who shared the now-viral clip. In the minute-long video, a female student can be seen getting up from her desk and walking out of the classroom as the student filming repeatedly exclaims, “Nah, mace is crazy!” Students in the classroom laugh and joke before following the rebellious student into the hallway, where she can be seen trying to get back her phone from her teacher.

        "text": "New York taxpayers are on the hook to pay government pension benefits for teachers union boss Randi Weingarten — one of the most powerful political operatives in the country — even though she hasn’t stepped into a classroom to teach for a quarter-century.  The culprit is a corrupt, unconstitutional practice that many taxpayers haven’t even heard about. It’s called union release time — and it benefits the government’s favored special interests at the taxpayers’ expense.  Weingarten is the head of the American Federation of Teachers, a private labor union with annual revenue of $200 million a year. The AFT is one of the most politically active special interests in America, giving tens of millions of dollars to political candidates, parties, and political action committees — more than 98% of which is directed to benefit Democrats, some estimates show.  NH LAWMAKER RIPS PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATION: 'LET THE TEACHERS TEACH, AND SHUT UP'  Weingarten claims to have once been a full-time teacher, but that appears to be true only for a tiny portion of her long career, and she hasn’t taught a single student since at least 1997. Since that time, she has worked full-time as a union boss, advocating for the private interests and political causes of the AFT and its affiliates.  © Twitter Randi Weingarten hasn't taught a class in 25 years but she will still get a pension paid by the taxpayers. Randi Weingarten hasn't taught a class in 25 years but she will still get a pension paid by the taxpayers. Twitter  In a recent report, the Freedom Foundation unearthed documents showing that even though Weingarten hasn’t been a public teacher for decades, she is nonetheless going to receive a taxpayer-funded pension because of release time.  READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP  This pernicious practice 'releases' government employees from the jobs they were originally hired to do, to instead work full-time for private labor unions — all while still receiving their full taxpayer-funded salaries and benefits, including pension benefits.  Release time flouts state constitutional anti-subsidy provisions intended to protect taxpayers against special interest abuse. It may also violate the First Amendment rights of government employees who do not want to support private union activities, as the Goldwater Institute, the free-market think tank where I work, has pointed out in challenging the legality of this practice.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Yet Goldwater Institute research shows that release time exists across the country at all levels of government, costing taxpayers millions of dollars.  Weingarten, for her part, has been on release time for 25 years, meaning she has worked full-time for a private union rather than discharging any public responsibilities. The AFT picks up the tab for her substantial $543,562 in annual compensation, but under an odd provision of the contract between her union and the school district, the district is still on the hook for her government pension benefits.  That means taxpayers in New York are going to pay for Weingarten’s retirement even though she hasn’t performed public service for a quarter-century.  Just like Weingarten, release time employees throughout the country receive government pension benefits for working full-time for private labor unions. That’s wrong: after all, tax dollars should be spent to advance the public interest, not pad the retirement of private, political activists.  The Freedom Foundation has done a valuable service in unearthing this outrageous taxpayer abuse. Now citizens should demand that their tax dollars stop funding special interests and the operatives who are getting rich representing them—and fund the public interest instead.

        "text": "© Natalie Behring/Getty A banner with photos of Tylee Ryan and her brother J.J. Vallow is seen on a fence set up as a memorial near where her body was found on May 10, 2023 in Rexburg, Idaho. Lori Vallow Daybell faces charges of murder, conspiracy and grand theft in connection to the deaths of two of her children — Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow — as well as Tammy Daybell, the previous wife of her husband Chad Daybell.  An Idaho jury found Lori Vallow Daybell guilty on all counts Friday for the murder of her two children and plotting to kill her husband's ex-wife.  The conviction comes after a three-year investigation into the 2019 deaths of Vallow's children, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua 'JJ' Vallow. Vallow was indicted alongside her husband, Chad Daybell, in the slayings of the children. Daybell is also facing a first-degree murder charge in the death of his ex-wife, Tammy Daybell, who was found dead in October 2019. Vallow was charged with conspiracy in Tammy Daybell's death.  Vallow was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of conspiracy, as well as grand theft charges for collecting Social Security benefits on behalf of Ryan and JJ Vallow after their deaths. She had pleaded not guilty to all counts.  Idaho Judge Steven Boyce previously granted a request from Vallow's lawyers to take the death penalty off the table, according to The New York Times. The convict now awaits a sentencing date where she will face life in prison.  Ryan and JJ Vallow were first reported missing in November 2019 by JJ's grandparents, Larry and Kay Woodcock. After Friday's verdict, Larry Woodcock addressed reporters outside the Boise, Idaho, courthouse, issuing thanks to the jurors. Woodcock also gave a 'final message' to Vallow, which was posted to Twitter by News Nation.  'Turn out the lights. Party's over,' he said. 'They say that that all good things must end. Lori, it ended.'  As he concluded his statements, Woodcock also gave a message to the deceased.  'JJ, I love you. Papa wishes you were here,' he said. 'Tylee, Papa loves you. Tammy, I never met you. Tammy, you are part of our life. Tammy I am sorry for what happened to you. My heart hurts for these three.'  Prosecutors said that both Vallow and Daybell had previously been involved in a cult-like, 'doomsday' belief system, and that Vallow believed her children were 'zombies' that had been possessed by evil spirits.  Vallow was served an order in January 2020 to prove that her missing children were alive and well, a moment that was caught on video showing both Vallow and Daybell sunbathing in Hawaii while her children were presumably missing. After she failed to prove her children were alive, she was arrested the following month.  In June 2020, investigators found human remains buried on Daybell's property that were later identified as belonging to Ryan and JJ Vallow, reported the Times.  Vallow was also convicted of conspiracy related to the murder of her ex-husband Charles Vallow, who was shot and killed by her now-deceased brother, Alex Cox, in July 2019. Cox claimed he fatally shot Charles Vallow out of self-defense and never faced charges. Cox died in December 2019, reportedly from a blood clot in his lung.  Vallow's trail had been delayed for years after she was initially declared not competent to stand trial and required to receive psychiatric treatment. A trial date has yet to be set for Daybell.  Newsweek has reached out via email to Vallow's attorney, Jim Archibald, for comment on today's verdict.

        "text": "Congress has sent legislation to raise the debt ceiling to President Biden, ending a months-long saga that brought the U.S. days away from a possible default.  The legislation was the product of months of gamesmanship between Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), culminated by furious negotiations and an aggressive effort by leaders in both parties to sell the agreement to their caucuses — which included a number of reluctant lawmakers.  Here are some of the biggest winners and losers from the fight.  WINNERS  Speaker Kevin McCarthy  © Provided by The Hill Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)  There is little question that McCarthy has emerged as the biggest winner of the fight — even if he has also had to take some criticism from his right flank.  McCarthy pushed a major bipartisan deal through Congress and proved wrong his critics who doubted his ability to get a GOP-backed bill raising the debt ceiling through the House.  That early victory gave the Speaker leverage in the subsequent talks, and it was the first big sign that the White House and Democrats had underestimated McCarthy after his rocky election as Speaker.  McCarthy won big Wednesday when 149 members, more than two-thirds of his conference, backed the bill — a show of support for their leader and a bit of a rebuke of the conservatives who had criticized him.  He’ll face challenges going forward, but this was a big political victory in McCarthy’s young Speakership.  Reps. Garret Graves (R-La.) and Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)  © Provided by The Hill Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) hugs Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)  Graves and McHenry, the Republicans appointed by McCarthy to hash out the debt deal, saw their star power grow throughout negotiations with the White House.  It was the second time this year that McCarthy called on the duo to assist him after the pair helped his climb to the Speakership in January.  After several fruitless meetings with Biden, McCarthy tapped Graves and McHenry — a “policy wonk” and the chair of the Financial Services Committee — to represent Republicans in negotiations with the White House.  The two delivered, breaking the political logjam and agreeing to a deal that won a big majority in the House and in the GOP conference.  In the process, Graves’s and McHenry’s work will foster talk about their own political futures, including whether either could be a House GOP leader or Speaker.  President Biden  © Provided by The Hill President Biden  Biden had to shift from his position that he would not negotiate on the debt ceiling. And he was forced to bow to GOP demands for lower domestic discretionary spending and new work requirements for food stamps, which infuriated liberals.  Yet Biden also emerged as a winner in the negotiations by getting the House GOP to agree to raise the debt ceiling through Jan. 1, 2025, kicking any future showdown beyond the elections next year.  In the end, Biden didn’t have to make any huge concessions. Even on the food stamps issue, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the government could spend more money on nutrition assistance under the deal because of provisions negotiated to increase access for veterans, the homeless and other vulnerable groups.  Biden took some criticism from the left, but a vast majority of the House Democratic caucus voted for the legislation.  In next year’s campaign, Biden will surely use the negotiations to argue that he’s a political leader able to work with Republicans and win bipartisan deals.  Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)  © Provided by The Hill Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)  Manchin for years has been pushing federal regulators to approve the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 303-mile natural gas project that cuts through the heart of Appalachia.  The debt-ceiling deal provides expedited permits allowing final construction of the pipeline to resume.  The provision is a huge victory for Manchin, who faces what’s shaping up to be the toughest reelection contest of his Senate tenure next year, when he’s facing a popular — and wealthy — GOP governor in Jim Justice.  The agreement also includes permitting reforms designed to expedite other energy infrastructure projects around the country, provisions Manchin can also point to next year.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  © Provided by The Hill Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  From the start, McConnell said that he would take a back seat on negotiations to raise the debt limit, insisting that it was a matter to be hashed out between the House and White House.  Many didn’t believe him. But in the end, he got exactly what he wanted.  The Senate GOP leader stayed on the sidelines throughout months of discussions over the borrowing limit, despite the White House trying to pull the Kentucky Republican into negotiations and Democrats hoping he would swoop in and land a debt limit deal with Biden, as the pair did in 2011.  “It was clear from the outset that preserving the full faith and credit of the United States was going to come down to an agreement that could both pass the people’s House and earn the president’s signature,” McConnell said in remarks on the Senate floor Thursday. “In other words, direct negotiations between Speaker McCarthy and President Biden. Just like I’ve said for months.”  LOSERS  The House Freedom Caucus  © Provided by The Hill Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas)  Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus didn’t like the final bill, but they couldn’t stop it.  And in the end, the vote wasn’t even really close.  “I’m trying to figure out exactly what conservatives should be happy about,” Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), a member of the group, said this week.  The bill doesn’t cut spending as much as they wanted, suspends the debt ceiling for almost a year longer than conservatives had hoped, and excludes a long list of policy provisions favored by the GOP, including the repeal of green energy tax credits and an immediate end to Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.  The bill also empowered McCarthy, who has to deal with threats to his continued Speakership from the right, but was able to signal his control over his conference with this week’s vote.  Progressives  © Provided by The Hill Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)  Liberals were also left grousing over the nature of the compromise, which included a long list of policies they oppose and led 46 of them in the House to vote against the legislation when it hit the floor Wednesday. Five Senate liberals also opposed the measure.  The progressives had urged Biden to hold the line in his demand for a “clean” debt ceiling hike, only to see the president come to the table and negotiate a host of cuts and policy changes.  They had opposed any new work requirements for social benefit programs, only to see Democratic leaders agree to new limits on eligibility for low-income food assistance.  They have howled at the notion of easing environmental reviews for energy infrastructure projects, which was included in the package.  And they had urged the president to demand tax hikes, not just spending cuts, as a deficit-reduction strategy — yet another item excluded from the final deal.  “This travesty has proven that we must once and for all reform the debt limit so that the working and poor people of this country can never be taken hostage again,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. <br><br><br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) emerged as the biggest winner of the debt ceiling fight.President Biden was able to kick the debt ceiling showdown beyond the elections next year.Sen.

        "text": "The military has tested the 'Angry Kitten' electronic warfare system on a variety of airborne platforms, including a Reaper drone. Here's why.  © Amber Monio / US Air National Guard An engineer specializing in electronic warfare works on an Angry Kitten pod that's on an F-16.  In April, the Air Force took its Angry Kitten out for a spin in the skies above Nevada. The feline-monikered system is a tool of electronic warfare, developed originally to simulate enemy systems in testing and training. Now, the Air Force is exploring using the system as an offensive tool, and as a weapon it can bring to future fights. This testing included putting the Angry Kitten on a Reaper drone.  Electronic warfare is an increasingly important part of how modern militaries fight. The systems generally operate on the electromagnetic spectrum outside the range of visible light, making their actions perceived primarily by their resulting negative effects on an adversary, like lost signals or incorrect sensor information. What makes Angry Kitten especially valuable as a training tool, and as a future weapon, is that it uses a software-defined radio to adjust frequencies, perceiving and then mimicking other aircraft, and overall making a fussy mess of their signals.  “Electronic Attack on the MQ-9 is a compelling capability,” said Michael Chmielewski, 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron commander, in a release. “15 hours of persistent noise integrated with a large force package will affect an adversary, require them to take some form of scalable action to honor it, and gets at the heart of strategic deterrence.”  In other words, putting the Angry Kitten on a Reaper drone means that the jamming system can be airborne for a long time, as Reapers are long-endurance drones. Any hostile air force looking to get around the jamming will need to attack the Reaper, which as an uncrewed plane is more expendable than a crewed fighter. Or, it means they will need to route around the jammed area, letting the Air Force dictate the terms of where and how a fight takes place.  Reapers were developed for and widely used during the long counter-insurgency wars waged by the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. These wars saw the drones’ long endurance, slow speed, and ability to loiter over an area as valuable assets, especially since the drones rarely had to contend with any anti-air missiles. They were operating in, to use Pentagon parlance, “uncontested” skies. As the Pentagon looks to the future, one in which it may be called upon to use existing equipment in a war against nations with fighter jets and sophisticated anti-air systems, it’d be easy to see Reapers sidelined as too slow, vulnerable, or irrelevant for the task.  Putting an Angry Kitten on a Reaper is a way to make the drone relevant again for other kinds of war.  [Related: The Air Force wants to start using its ‘Angry Kitten’ system in combat]  “The goal is to expand the mission sets the MQ-9 can accomplish,” said Aaron Aguilar, 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron assistant director of operations, in the same release. “The proliferation and persistence of MQ-9s in theater allows us to fill traditional platform capability gaps that may be present. Our goal is to augment assets that already fill this role so they can focus and prioritize efforts in areas they are best suited for.”  Putting the Angry Kitten on a Reaper turns a counter-insurgency hunter-killer into a conventional-war surveillance platform and jammer. It emphasizes what the tool on hand can already do well, while giving it a different set of ways to interact with a different expected array of foes.  An earlier exercise this spring saw the Air National Guard test landing and launching a Reaper from a highway in Wyoming, expanding how and where it can operate. The ability to quickly deploy, refuel, rearm, and relaunch Reapers, from found runways as well as established bases, can expand how the drones are used.  In addition to testing the Angry Kitten with Reapers, the Air Force tested the Angry Kitten in Alaska on F-16 Fighting Falcons and A-10 Thunderbolts, both older planes originally designed for warfare against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. In the decades since, Fighting Falcons—known more colloquially as vipers—have expanded to become a widely used versatile fighter in the arsenal of the US and a range of nations. Meanwhile, the Air Force has long worked to retire the A-10s, arguing that they lack protection against modern weapons. That process began in earnest this spring, with the oldest models selected for the boneyard.  In the meantime, putting the Angry Kitten on drones and planes still in service means expanding not just what those planes can do, but potentially how effective they can be against sophisticated weapons. Targeting systems, from those used by planes to find targets to those used by missiles to track them, can be disrupted or fooled by malicious signals. An old plane may not be able to survive a hit from a modern missile, but jamming a missile so that misses its mark is better protection than any armor.

        "text": "Â© Provided by Washington Examiner  San Franciscoâs downward spiral is continuing as it becomes clear that the city has dug itself far too deep a hole to get out of anytime soon.  Nordstrom is the latest company to call it quits in downtown San Francisco, announcing that its five-floor location at the Westfield Mall and its discount outlet, Nordstrom Rack, will be shutting down in the summer once the storesâ leases expire. According to the department store company, âthe dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market have changed dramatically over the past several years, impacting customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully.â  SAN FRANCISCO REPEALS BAN ON TRAVEL TO STATES WITH RESTRICTIONS ON LGBT PEOPLE AND ABORTION  Downtown San Francisco has been in decay for years due to crime, and the closures are only accelerating now as companies reexamine their positions. Whole Foods shuttered a location after less than a year of operation after spending that time making regular emergency calls. Last week, San Francisco finally decided to arrest someone, but that person was a security guard who shot and killed a shoplifter in self-defense. (The charges against that security guard were later dropped.)  The spiral is only going to become worse as these closures snowball. One restaurant worker said Nordstromâs departure would hurt their business, as it would bring even less traffic to the mall. While the benefits of remaining open drop as the potential customer base decreases, the safety risks stay the same. One intersection near the mall was the site of 586 emergency calls through the first four months of the year, an average of nearly five emergency calls a day.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  This collapse is playing out on a larger scale across the city. The flight of residents and businesses is causing the cityâs tax revenue to crater, leaving San Francisco anticipating a budget deficit of nearly $800 million. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has sent in the National Guard and the California Highway Patrol to help the city deal with its surge in fentanyl overdose deaths.  This is what years of enabling criminal behavior buys you. Businesses flee and residents join them.

        "text": "© Raw Story Governor Florida Ron DeSantis. Ron DeSantis on Friday appeared to side with a parent with ties to an extremist group that promotes violence who was behind an elementary school's ban of a book by National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman. The Florida governor, who on Wednesday announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, appeared to support Daily Salinas, whose complaint led a Florida public school to restrict access to “The Hill We Climb,” a book adaptation of the poem Gorman recited at President Joe Biden’s inauguration. Salinas complained that the book, which she inaccurately stated was authored by Oprah Winfrey, was inappropriate for children. Tthe book includes a forward by Winfrey. Salinas, who has two children at the Bob Graham Dducation Center in Miami Lakes, is the only parent who complained about the books. She cited critical race theory, gender ideology, and indoctrination as the reasons she believed the books to be inappropriate. Salinas was photographed attending Proud Boys rallies and has ties to the ultraconservative Moms For Liberty. She posted antisemitic memes on social media that she later apologized for. DeSantis in a speech on Friday appeared to reference the Gorman poetry ban, The Guardian reports. “This is some book of poems, I never heard of it, I had nothing to do with any of this, that was in an elementary school library and the school or the school district determined that was more appropriate to be in the middle school library. So they moved it,” DeSantis said at a parent-educators association homeschool convention in Orlando. DeSantis accused the mainstream media of spreading a “hoax.” “The media, when they talk about ‘book ban’, understand that is a hoax. They are creating a false narrative,” he said. “These legacy media outlets are … trying to create a political narrative that is totally divorced from the facts and if they’re going to do something like this ridiculous poem hoax and actually put that out there and think that you’re going to believe it, they’re insulting your intelligence and our country.” The Florida governor suggested that parents such as Salinas are protecting children from a “ideological agenda.” “They don’t want the parents involved in education because they view you as an impediment to their ideological agenda,” he said. “They view you as an impediment to their ability to indoctrinate kids with their beliefs and their agendas. I’m sorry, I choose our beliefs as parents over the beliefs of the ideological left. “We want parents to be armed with the ability to make sure their kids are in a safe environment, and yet you have narrative, and you have the left trying to jam this in.” Read the full article here.

        "text": "© Provided by The Associated Press FILE — This March 28, 2017 photo, provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry, shows Jeffrey Epstein. Nearly four years after Epstein died in jail in New York, the AP has obtained more than 4,000 pages of documents related to his death from the Bureau of Prisons under the Freedom of Information Law. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Two weeks before ending his life, Jeffrey Epstein sat in the corner of his Manhattan jail cell with his hands over his ears, desperate to muffle the sound of a toilet that wouldn’t stop running.  Epstein was agitated and unable to sleep, jail officials observed in records newly obtained by The Associated Press. He called himself a “coward” and complained he was struggling to adapt to life behind bars following his July 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges — his life of luxury reduced to a concrete and steel cage.  The disgraced financier was under psychological observation at the time for a suicide attempt just days earlier that left his neck bruised and scraped. Yet, even after a 31-hour stint on suicide watch, Epstein insisted he wasn't suicidal, telling a jail psychologist he had a “wonderful life” and “would be crazy” to end it.  On Aug. 10, 2019, Epstein was dead.  Nearly four years later, the AP has obtained more than 4,000 pages of documents related to Epstein’s death from the federal Bureau of Prisons under the Freedom of Information Act. They include a detailed psychological reconstruction of the events leading to Epstein's suicide, as well as his health history, internal agency reports, emails and memos and other records.  Taken together, the documents the AP obtained Thursday provide the most complete accounting to date of Epstein's detention and death, and its chaotic aftermath. The records help to dispel the many conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's suicide, underscoring how fundamental failings at the Bureau of Prisons — including severe staffing shortages and employees cutting corners — contributed to Epstein's death.  © Provided by The Associated Press FILE — This image provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement shows financier Jeffrey Epstein, July 25, 2013. Nearly four years after Epstein died in jail in New York, the AP has obtained more than 4,000 pages of documents related to his death from the Bureau of Prisons under the Freedom of Information Law. (Florida Department of Law Enforcement via AP, File)  They shed new light on the federal prison agency's muddled response after Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at the now-shuttered Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City.  In one email, a prosecutor involved in Epstein's criminal case complained about a lack of information from the Bureau of Prisons in the critical hours after his death, writing that it was “frankly unbelievable” that the agency was issuing public press releases 'before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family.”  In another email, a high-ranking Bureau of Prisons official made a spurious suggestion to the agency’s director that news reporters must have been paying jail employees for information about Epstein’s death because they were reporting details of the agency’s failings — impugning the ethics of journalists and the agency's own workers.  The documents also provide a fresh window into Epstein's behavior during his 36 days in jail, including his previously unreported attempt to connect by mail with another high-profile pedophile: Larry Nassar, the U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of athletes.  Epstein's letter to Nassar was found returned to sender in the jail’s mail room weeks after Epstein’s death. “It appeared he mailed it out and it was returned back to him,' the investigator who found the letter told a prison official by email. 'I am not sure if I should open it or should we hand it over to anyone?”  The letter itself was not included among the documents turned over to the AP.  The night before Epstein’s death, he excused himself from a meeting with his lawyers to make a telephone call to his family. According to a memo from a unit manager, Epstein told a jail employee that he was calling his mother, who’d been dead for 15 years at that point.  Epstein's death put increased scrutiny on the Bureau of Prisons and led the agency to close the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 2021. It spurred an AP investigation that has uncovered deep, previously unreported problems within the agency, the Justice Department’s largest with more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates and an $8 billion annual budget.  An internal memo, undated but sent after Epstein’s death, attributed problems at the jail to “seriously reduced staffing levels, improper or lack of training, and follow up and oversight.” The memo also detailed steps the Bureau of Prisons has taken to remedy lapses Epstein’s suicide exposed, including requiring supervisors to review surveillance video to ensure officers made required cell checks.  Epstein’s lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said people detained at the facility endured “medieval conditions of confinement that no American defend that should have been subjected to.”  “It’s sad, it’s tragic that it took this kind of event to finally cause the Bureau of Prisons to close this regrettable institution,” Weinberg said Thursday in a telephone interview.  The workers tasked with guarding Epstein the night he killed himself, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged with lying on prison records to make it seem as though they had made their required checks before Epstein was found lifeless. Epstein’s cellmate did not return after a court hearing the day before, and prison officials failed to pair another prisoner with him, leaving him alone.  Prosecutors alleged they were sitting at their desks just 15 feet (4.6 meters) from Epstein’s cell, shopped online for furniture and motorcycles, and walked around the unit’s common area instead of making required rounds every 30 minutes.  During one two-hour period, both appeared to have been asleep, according to their indictment. Noel and Thomas admitted to falsifying the log entries but avoided prison time under a deal with federal prosecutors. Copies of some of those logs were included among the documents released Thursday, with the guards' signatures redacted.  Another investigation, by the Justice Department’s inspector general, is still ongoing.  Epstein arrived at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on July 6, 2019. He spent 22 hours in the jail's general population before officials moved him to the special housing unit “due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among the inmate population,” according to the psychological reconstruction of his death.  Epstein later said he was upset about having to wear an orange jumpsuit provided to inmates in the special housing unit and complained about being treated like he was a “bad guy” despite being well behaved behind bars. He requested a brown uniform for his near-daily visits with his lawyers.  During an initial health screening, the 66-year-old said that he had 10-plus female sexual partners within the previous five years. Medical records showed he was suffering from sleep apnea, constipation, hypertension, lower back pain and prediabetes and had been previously treated for chlamydia.  Epstein did make some attempts to adapt to his jailhouse surroundings, the records show. He signed up for a Kosher meal and told prison officials, through his lawyer, that he wanted permission to exercise outside. Two days before he was found dead, Epstein bought $73.85 worth of items from the prison commissary, including an AM/FM radio and headphones. He had $566 left in his account when he died.  Epstein's outlook worsened when a judge denied him bail on July 18, 2019 — raising the prospect that he'd remain locked up until trial and, possibly longer. If convicted, he faced up to 45 years prison. Four days later, Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck.  Epstein survived. His injuries didn't require going to the hospital. He was placed on suicide watch and, later, psychiatric observation. Jail officers noted in logs that they observed him, “sitting at the edge of the bed, lost in thought,” and sitting “with his head against the wall.”  Epstein expressed frustration with the noise of the jail and his lack of sleep. His first few weeks at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Epstein didn't have his sleep apnea breathing apparatus he used. Then, the toilet in his cell started acting up.  “He was still left in the same cell with a broken toilet,' the jail's chief psychologist wrote in a email the next day. 'Please move him to the cell next door when he returns from legal as the toilet still does not work.”  The day before Epstein ended his life, a federal judge unsealed about 2,000 pages of documents in a sexual abuse lawsuit against him. That development, prison officials observed, further eroded Epstein's previous elevated status.  That, combined with a lack of significant interpersonal connections and 'the idea of potentially spending his life in prison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide,” officials wrote.  __  Associated Press writers Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland, Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia, Sam Metz in Salt Lake City, Jake Offenhartz and David B.

        "text": "© Provided by Salon Donald TrumpJabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images  Donald Trump attacked E. Jean Carroll after she amended her 2019 defamation lawsuit to include the former president's attacks at this month's CNN town hall.  Carroll's Monday filing followed Trump's continued denial of her sexual assault and defamation allegations, even after a jury found the ex-president liable for both counts on May 9. The columnist is seeking further damages in addition to the $5 million she was awarded earlier this month.  During a CNN town hall appearance only a day after being found liable, Trump repudiated Carroll's claims, calling her a 'wack job' and referring to the case as 'a rigged deal.'  'This conduct supports a very substantial punitive damages award in Carroll's favor both to punish Trump, to deter him from engaging in further defamation, and to deter others from doing the same,' the filing says.  NBC reported that the newly refined suit seeks a total of at least $10 million in damages as well as additional 'punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial.'  'I don't know E. Jean Carroll,' Trump wrote in a Tuesday Truth Social post. 'I never met her or touched her ￼(except on a celebrity line with her African American husband who she disgustingly called the 'Ape,'), I wouldn't want to know or touch her, I never abused her or raped her or took her to a dressing room 25 years ago in a crowded department store where the doors are LOCKED, she has no idea when, or did anything else to her, except deny her Fake, Made Up Story, that she wrote in a book. IT NEVER HAPPENED, IS A TOTAL SCAM, UNFAIR TRIAL!'  Trump also argued that the Carroll case had a distinctly political motivation, writing that it was 'part of the Democrats playbook to tarnish my name and person, much like the now fully debunked Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, the 51 Intelligence Agents, FBI/Twitter Files, and so much more.'  'It is being funded and tried by Democrat operatives, although this was denied by them, and when they got caught in the lie, the Clinton appointed judge would not let us use it in trial,' he continued. 'Time will prove him to be highly partisan & very unfair. Where's the dress she said she had?'  Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer?

'Trump keeps defaming E Jean Carroll,' Jose Pagliery, who covered the trial for The Daily Beast, tweeted in response to Trump's latest attack. 'This afternoon, a NY state court judge in an unrelated case will warn Trump about his online behavior. He's giving the judge ample reason to doubt whether he can abide by court orders—and common decency. Quite the fast-moving train wreck.'  'Trump just wants to keep paying @ejeancarroll more and more money in damages,' quipped MSNBC legal analyst Katie Phang.<br><br><br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>Donald Trump attacked E.
