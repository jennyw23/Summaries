        "text": "© Getty Images GettyImages-1254694766.jpg  So far, Governor Ron DeSantis has yet to actually announce his candidacy for president, despite the fact he all but certainly will jump in the ring. But his decision to wait until the conclusion of Florida’s legislative session and to not directly attack former president Donald Trump has made him uniquely vulnerable to the former president’s barbs.  This weekend, Mr DeSantis caught a break when he and Mr Trump both happened to be in Iowa and the former president’s event got rained out. This gave Mr DeSantis, a politician notorious for his poor retail politics skills, to press the flesh unfettered by the spectre of the former president.  But Mr DeSantis took two kicks to the chin on Tuesday evening. First in Jacksonville, the 12th largest city in America, Mr DeSantis had endorsed the Republican candidate Daniel Davis for mayor.  Jacksonville was the largest city in the United States with a Republican mayor. But Democrat Donna Deegan beat back Mr Davis and will become the city’s first female mayor.  Meanwhile, in Kentucky, Mr DeSantis and Mr Trump engaged in a proxy war in the GOP gubernatorial primary. Mr Trump had endorsed Attorney General Daniel Cameron. This came despite the fact that Mr Cameron is a known protege of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom Mr Trump despises but who keeps an iron grip on the state party. Mr DeSantis, for his part, endorsed Mr Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft in the primary.  Ultimately, Mr Cameron prevailed and Mr Trump could not help but gloat on Truth Social, calling the governor “DeSanctimonious” and saying “The DeSanctimonious backed candidate came in a DISTANT third. Ron’s magic is GONE!” Mr Trump also noted that “DeSanctimonious lost Jacksonville and Kentucky last night. Not good!!!”  Of course, endorsements alone do not determine election results, and multiple factors played into the results in Jacksonville and Kentucky – they are both off-year elections with significantly low turnout. But Mr DeSantis still chose to get involved in both races to flex his political clout, and now he has little to show for it.  Polling has shown that Mr DeSantis has taken a steep tumble ever since his resounding double-digit re-election campaign in November. And when Mr DeSantis has tried to even subtly attack the former president, as he tried doing before Mr Trump’s arrest in relation to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, he has faced the MAGA wrath.  Not only that, but even when Mr DeSantis’ surrogates try to hit back at the former president, it does Mr DeSantis more harm than good. Last week, during Mr Trump’s CNN town hall, Never Back Down, a Super PAC that supports Mr DeSantis, put out a tweet deriding Mr Trump. But Semafor reported that the super PAC now regrets putting out the tweet, with one person calling it a “massive mistake.”  Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis are also now engaged in a war of words on abortion, with Mr Trump hitting Mr DeSantis for signing a six-week abortion ban. He told newly launched outlet The Messenger, “Many people within the pro-life movement feel that that was too harsh,” while Mr DeSantis said “Protecting an unborn child when there’s a detectable heartbeat is something that almost 99% of pro-lifers support.”  All of this comes before Mr DeSantis has even thrown his hat in the race. But he risks being significantly weakened right out of the gate, with his best hope riding on the possibility that Mr Trump will implode.

Dramatic cellphone footage taken during class Friday at Antioch High School captured the rambunctious student confronting her teacher after her phone was taken away as a disciplinary action. The disobedient student had been “texting and Googling answers for her school work,” according to Reddit user @Lazy_Mouse3803, who shared the now-viral clip. In the minute-long video, a female student can be seen getting up from her desk and walking out of the classroom as the student filming repeatedly exclaims, “Nah, mace is crazy!” Students in the classroom laugh and joke before following the rebellious student into the hallway, where she can be seen trying to get back her phone from her teacher.

        "text": "New York taxpayers are on the hook to pay government pension benefits for teachers union boss Randi Weingarten — one of the most powerful political operatives in the country — even though she hasn’t stepped into a classroom to teach for a quarter-century.  The culprit is a corrupt, unconstitutional practice that many taxpayers haven’t even heard about. It’s called union release time — and it benefits the government’s favored special interests at the taxpayers’ expense.  Weingarten is the head of the American Federation of Teachers, a private labor union with annual revenue of $200 million a year. The AFT is one of the most politically active special interests in America, giving tens of millions of dollars to political candidates, parties, and political action committees — more than 98% of which is directed to benefit Democrats, some estimates show.  NH LAWMAKER RIPS PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATION: 'LET THE TEACHERS TEACH, AND SHUT UP'  Weingarten claims to have once been a full-time teacher, but that appears to be true only for a tiny portion of her long career, and she hasn’t taught a single student since at least 1997. Since that time, she has worked full-time as a union boss, advocating for the private interests and political causes of the AFT and its affiliates.  © Twitter Randi Weingarten hasn't taught a class in 25 years but she will still get a pension paid by the taxpayers. Randi Weingarten hasn't taught a class in 25 years but she will still get a pension paid by the taxpayers. Twitter  In a recent report, the Freedom Foundation unearthed documents showing that even though Weingarten hasn’t been a public teacher for decades, she is nonetheless going to receive a taxpayer-funded pension because of release time.  READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP  This pernicious practice \"releases\" government employees from the jobs they were originally hired to do, to instead work full-time for private labor unions — all while still receiving their full taxpayer-funded salaries and benefits, including pension benefits.  Release time flouts state constitutional anti-subsidy provisions intended to protect taxpayers against special interest abuse. It may also violate the First Amendment rights of government employees who do not want to support private union activities, as the Goldwater Institute, the free-market think tank where I work, has pointed out in challenging the legality of this practice.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Yet Goldwater Institute research shows that release time exists across the country at all levels of government, costing taxpayers millions of dollars.  Weingarten, for her part, has been on release time for 25 years, meaning she has worked full-time for a private union rather than discharging any public responsibilities. The AFT picks up the tab for her substantial $543,562 in annual compensation, but under an odd provision of the contract between her union and the school district, the district is still on the hook for her government pension benefits.  That means taxpayers in New York are going to pay for Weingarten’s retirement even though she hasn’t performed public service for a quarter-century.  Just like Weingarten, release time employees throughout the country receive government pension benefits for working full-time for private labor unions. That’s wrong: after all, tax dollars should be spent to advance the public interest, not pad the retirement of private, political activists.  The Freedom Foundation has done a valuable service in unearthing this outrageous taxpayer abuse. Now citizens should demand that their tax dollars stop funding special interests and the operatives who are getting rich representing them—and fund the public interest instead.

        "text": "© Natalie Behring/Getty A banner with photos of Tylee Ryan and her brother J.J. Vallow is seen on a fence set up as a memorial near where her body was found on May 10, 2023 in Rexburg, Idaho. Lori Vallow Daybell faces charges of murder, conspiracy and grand theft in connection to the deaths of two of her children — Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow — as well as Tammy Daybell, the previous wife of her husband Chad Daybell.  An Idaho jury found Lori Vallow Daybell guilty on all counts Friday for the murder of her two children and plotting to kill her husband's ex-wife.  The conviction comes after a three-year investigation into the 2019 deaths of Vallow's children, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow. Vallow was indicted alongside her husband, Chad Daybell, in the slayings of the children. Daybell is also facing a first-degree murder charge in the death of his ex-wife, Tammy Daybell, who was found dead in October 2019. Vallow was charged with conspiracy in Tammy Daybell's death.  Vallow was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of conspiracy, as well as grand theft charges for collecting Social Security benefits on behalf of Ryan and JJ Vallow after their deaths. She had pleaded not guilty to all counts.  Idaho Judge Steven Boyce previously granted a request from Vallow's lawyers to take the death penalty off the table, according to The New York Times. The convict now awaits a sentencing date where she will face life in prison.  Ryan and JJ Vallow were first reported missing in November 2019 by JJ's grandparents, Larry and Kay Woodcock. After Friday's verdict, Larry Woodcock addressed reporters outside the Boise, Idaho, courthouse, issuing thanks to the jurors. Woodcock also gave a \"final message\" to Vallow, which was posted to Twitter by News Nation.  \"Turn out the lights. Party's over,\" he said. \"They say that that all good things must end. Lori, it ended.\"  As he concluded his statements, Woodcock also gave a message to the deceased.  \"JJ, I love you. Papa wishes you were here,\" he said. \"Tylee, Papa loves you. Tammy, I never met you. Tammy, you are part of our life. Tammy I am sorry for what happened to you. My heart hurts for these three.\"  Prosecutors said that both Vallow and Daybell had previously been involved in a cult-like, \"doomsday\" belief system, and that Vallow believed her children were \"zombies\" that had been possessed by evil spirits.  Vallow was served an order in January 2020 to prove that her missing children were alive and well, a moment that was caught on video showing both Vallow and Daybell sunbathing in Hawaii while her children were presumably missing. After she failed to prove her children were alive, she was arrested the following month.  In June 2020, investigators found human remains buried on Daybell's property that were later identified as belonging to Ryan and JJ Vallow, reported the Times.  Vallow was also convicted of conspiracy related to the murder of her ex-husband Charles Vallow, who was shot and killed by her now-deceased brother, Alex Cox, in July 2019. Cox claimed he fatally shot Charles Vallow out of self-defense and never faced charges. Cox died in December 2019, reportedly from a blood clot in his lung.  Vallow's trail had been delayed for years after she was initially declared not competent to stand trial and required to receive psychiatric treatment. A trial date has yet to be set for Daybell.  Newsweek has reached out via email to Vallow's attorney, Jim Archibald, for comment on today's verdict.

        "text": "Congress has sent legislation to raise the debt ceiling to President Biden, ending a months-long saga that brought the U.S. days away from a possible default.  The legislation was the product of months of gamesmanship between Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), culminated by furious negotiations and an aggressive effort by leaders in both parties to sell the agreement to their caucuses — which included a number of reluctant lawmakers.  Here are some of the biggest winners and losers from the fight.  WINNERS  Speaker Kevin McCarthy  © Provided by The Hill Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)  There is little question that McCarthy has emerged as the biggest winner of the fight — even if he has also had to take some criticism from his right flank.  McCarthy pushed a major bipartisan deal through Congress and proved wrong his critics who doubted his ability to get a GOP-backed bill raising the debt ceiling through the House.  That early victory gave the Speaker leverage in the subsequent talks, and it was the first big sign that the White House and Democrats had underestimated McCarthy after his rocky election as Speaker.  McCarthy won big Wednesday when 149 members, more than two-thirds of his conference, backed the bill — a show of support for their leader and a bit of a rebuke of the conservatives who had criticized him.  He’ll face challenges going forward, but this was a big political victory in McCarthy’s young Speakership.  Reps. Garret Graves (R-La.) and Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)  © Provided by The Hill Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) hugs Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)  Graves and McHenry, the Republicans appointed by McCarthy to hash out the debt deal, saw their star power grow throughout negotiations with the White House.  It was the second time this year that McCarthy called on the duo to assist him after the pair helped his climb to the Speakership in January.  After several fruitless meetings with Biden, McCarthy tapped Graves and McHenry — a “policy wonk” and the chair of the Financial Services Committee — to represent Republicans in negotiations with the White House.  The two delivered, breaking the political logjam and agreeing to a deal that won a big majority in the House and in the GOP conference.  In the process, Graves’s and McHenry’s work will foster talk about their own political futures, including whether either could be a House GOP leader or Speaker.  President Biden  © Provided by The Hill President Biden  Biden had to shift from his position that he would not negotiate on the debt ceiling. And he was forced to bow to GOP demands for lower domestic discretionary spending and new work requirements for food stamps, which infuriated liberals.  Yet Biden also emerged as a winner in the negotiations by getting the House GOP to agree to raise the debt ceiling through Jan. 1, 2025, kicking any future showdown beyond the elections next year.  In the end, Biden didn’t have to make any huge concessions. Even on the food stamps issue, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the government could spend more money on nutrition assistance under the deal because of provisions negotiated to increase access for veterans, the homeless and other vulnerable groups.  Biden took some criticism from the left, but a vast majority of the House Democratic caucus voted for the legislation.  In next year’s campaign, Biden will surely use the negotiations to argue that he’s a political leader able to work with Republicans and win bipartisan deals.  Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)  © Provided by The Hill Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)  Manchin for years has been pushing federal regulators to approve the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 303-mile natural gas project that cuts through the heart of Appalachia.  The debt-ceiling deal provides expedited permits allowing final construction of the pipeline to resume.  The provision is a huge victory for Manchin, who faces what’s shaping up to be the toughest reelection contest of his Senate tenure next year, when he’s facing a popular — and wealthy — GOP governor in Jim Justice.  The agreement also includes permitting reforms designed to expedite other energy infrastructure projects around the country, provisions Manchin can also point to next year.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  © Provided by The Hill Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  From the start, McConnell said that he would take a back seat on negotiations to raise the debt limit, insisting that it was a matter to be hashed out between the House and White House.  Many didn’t believe him. But in the end, he got exactly what he wanted.  The Senate GOP leader stayed on the sidelines throughout months of discussions over the borrowing limit, despite the White House trying to pull the Kentucky Republican into negotiations and Democrats hoping he would swoop in and land a debt limit deal with Biden, as the pair did in 2011.  “It was clear from the outset that preserving the full faith and credit of the United States was going to come down to an agreement that could both pass the people’s House and earn the president’s signature,” McConnell said in remarks on the Senate floor Thursday. “In other words, direct negotiations between Speaker McCarthy and President Biden. Just like I’ve said for months.”  LOSERS  The House Freedom Caucus  © Provided by The Hill Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas)  Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus didn’t like the final bill, but they couldn’t stop it.  And in the end, the vote wasn’t even really close.  “I’m trying to figure out exactly what conservatives should be happy about,” Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), a member of the group, said this week.  The bill doesn’t cut spending as much as they wanted, suspends the debt ceiling for almost a year longer than conservatives had hoped, and excludes a long list of policy provisions favored by the GOP, including the repeal of green energy tax credits and an immediate end to Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.  The bill also empowered McCarthy, who has to deal with threats to his continued Speakership from the right, but was able to signal his control over his conference with this week’s vote.  Progressives  © Provided by The Hill Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)  Liberals were also left grousing over the nature of the compromise, which included a long list of policies they oppose and led 46 of them in the House to vote against the legislation when it hit the floor Wednesday. Five Senate liberals also opposed the measure.  The progressives had urged Biden to hold the line in his demand for a “clean” debt ceiling hike, only to see the president come to the table and negotiate a host of cuts and policy changes.  They had opposed any new work requirements for social benefit programs, only to see Democratic leaders agree to new limits on eligibility for low-income food assistance.  They have howled at the notion of easing environmental reviews for energy infrastructure projects, which was included in the package.  And they had urged the president to demand tax hikes, not just spending cuts, as a deficit-reduction strategy — yet another item excluded from the final deal.  “This travesty has proven that we must once and for all reform the debt limit so that the working and poor people of this country can never be taken hostage again,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) emerged as the biggest winner of the debt ceiling fight.\nPresident Biden was able to kick the debt ceiling showdown beyond the elections next year.\nSen.

        "text": "The military has tested the \"Angry Kitten\" electronic warfare system on a variety of airborne platforms, including a Reaper drone. Here's why.  © Amber Monio / US Air National Guard An engineer specializing in electronic warfare works on an Angry Kitten pod that's on an F-16.  In April, the Air Force took its Angry Kitten out for a spin in the skies above Nevada. The feline-monikered system is a tool of electronic warfare, developed originally to simulate enemy systems in testing and training. Now, the Air Force is exploring using the system as an offensive tool, and as a weapon it can bring to future fights. This testing included putting the Angry Kitten on a Reaper drone.  Electronic warfare is an increasingly important part of how modern militaries fight. The systems generally operate on the electromagnetic spectrum outside the range of visible light, making their actions perceived primarily by their resulting negative effects on an adversary, like lost signals or incorrect sensor information. What makes Angry Kitten especially valuable as a training tool, and as a future weapon, is that it uses a software-defined radio to adjust frequencies, perceiving and then mimicking other aircraft, and overall making a fussy mess of their signals.  “Electronic Attack on the MQ-9 is a compelling capability,” said Michael Chmielewski, 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron commander, in a release. “15 hours of persistent noise integrated with a large force package will affect an adversary, require them to take some form of scalable action to honor it, and gets at the heart of strategic deterrence.”  In other words, putting the Angry Kitten on a Reaper drone means that the jamming system can be airborne for a long time, as Reapers are long-endurance drones. Any hostile air force looking to get around the jamming will need to attack the Reaper, which as an uncrewed plane is more expendable than a crewed fighter. Or, it means they will need to route around the jammed area, letting the Air Force dictate the terms of where and how a fight takes place.  Reapers were developed for and widely used during the long counter-insurgency wars waged by the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. These wars saw the drones’ long endurance, slow speed, and ability to loiter over an area as valuable assets, especially since the drones rarely had to contend with any anti-air missiles. They were operating in, to use Pentagon parlance, “uncontested” skies. As the Pentagon looks to the future, one in which it may be called upon to use existing equipment in a war against nations with fighter jets and sophisticated anti-air systems, it’d be easy to see Reapers sidelined as too slow, vulnerable, or irrelevant for the task.  Putting an Angry Kitten on a Reaper is a way to make the drone relevant again for other kinds of war.  [Related: The Air Force wants to start using its ‘Angry Kitten’ system in combat]  “The goal is to expand the mission sets the MQ-9 can accomplish,” said Aaron Aguilar, 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron assistant director of operations, in the same release. “The proliferation and persistence of MQ-9s in theater allows us to fill traditional platform capability gaps that may be present. Our goal is to augment assets that already fill this role so they can focus and prioritize efforts in areas they are best suited for.”  Putting the Angry Kitten on a Reaper turns a counter-insurgency hunter-killer into a conventional-war surveillance platform and jammer. It emphasizes what the tool on hand can already do well, while giving it a different set of ways to interact with a different expected array of foes.  An earlier exercise this spring saw the Air National Guard test landing and launching a Reaper from a highway in Wyoming, expanding how and where it can operate. The ability to quickly deploy, refuel, rearm, and relaunch Reapers, from found runways as well as established bases, can expand how the drones are used.  In addition to testing the Angry Kitten with Reapers, the Air Force tested the Angry Kitten in Alaska on F-16 Fighting Falcons and A-10 Thunderbolts, both older planes originally designed for warfare against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. In the decades since, Fighting Falcons—known more colloquially as vipers—have expanded to become a widely used versatile fighter in the arsenal of the US and a range of nations. Meanwhile, the Air Force has long worked to retire the A-10s, arguing that they lack protection against modern weapons. That process began in earnest this spring, with the oldest models selected for the boneyard.  In the meantime, putting the Angry Kitten on drones and planes still in service means expanding not just what those planes can do, but potentially how effective they can be against sophisticated weapons. Targeting systems, from those used by planes to find targets to those used by missiles to track them, can be disrupted or fooled by malicious signals. An old plane may not be able to survive a hit from a modern missile, but jamming a missile so that misses its mark is better protection than any armor.

        "text": "Â© Provided by Washington Examiner  San Franciscoâs downward spiral is continuing as it becomes clear that the city has dug itself far too deep a hole to get out of anytime soon.  Nordstrom is the latest company to call it quits in downtown San Francisco, announcing that its five-floor location at the Westfield Mall and its discount outlet, Nordstrom Rack, will be shutting down in the summer once the storesâ leases expire. According to the department store company, âthe dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market have changed dramatically over the past several years, impacting customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully.â  SAN FRANCISCO REPEALS BAN ON TRAVEL TO STATES WITH RESTRICTIONS ON LGBT PEOPLE AND ABORTION  Downtown San Francisco has been in decay for years due to crime, and the closures are only accelerating now as companies reexamine their positions. Whole Foods shuttered a location after less than a year of operation after spending that time making regular emergency calls. Last week, San Francisco finally decided to arrest someone, but that person was a security guard who shot and killed a shoplifter in self-defense. (The charges against that security guard were later dropped.)  The spiral is only going to become worse as these closures snowball. One restaurant worker said Nordstromâs departure would hurt their business, as it would bring even less traffic to the mall. While the benefits of remaining open drop as the potential customer base decreases, the safety risks stay the same. One intersection near the mall was the site of 586 emergency calls through the first four months of the year, an average of nearly five emergency calls a day.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  This collapse is playing out on a larger scale across the city. The flight of residents and businesses is causing the cityâs tax revenue to crater, leaving San Francisco anticipating a budget deficit of nearly $800 million. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has sent in the National Guard and the California Highway Patrol to help the city deal with its surge in fentanyl overdose deaths.  This is what years of enabling criminal behavior buys you. Businesses flee and residents join them. Their departures lead more businesses and more residents to follow, as crime, homelessness, and drug addiction show no signs of improvement while the few perks of living in the unreasonably expensive city fade away. San Franciscoâs spiral is going to become worse before it gets better. Who knows how many residents will stick around for it?

        "text": "© Raw Story Governor Florida Ron DeSantis. Ron DeSantis on Friday appeared to side with a parent with ties to an extremist group that promotes violence who was behind an elementary school's ban of a book by National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman. The Florida governor, who on Wednesday announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, appeared to support Daily Salinas, whose complaint led a Florida public school to restrict access to “The Hill We Climb,” a book adaptation of the poem Gorman recited at President Joe Biden’s inauguration. Salinas complained that the book, which she inaccurately stated was authored by Oprah Winfrey, was inappropriate for children. Tthe book includes a forward by Winfrey. Salinas, who has two children at the Bob Graham Dducation Center in Miami Lakes, is the only parent who complained about the books. She cited critical race theory, gender ideology, and indoctrination as the reasons she believed the books to be inappropriate. Salinas was photographed attending Proud Boys rallies and has ties to the ultraconservative Moms For Liberty. She posted antisemitic memes on social media that she later apologized for. DeSantis in a speech on Friday appeared to reference the Gorman poetry ban, The Guardian reports. “This is some book of poems, I never heard of it, I had nothing to do with any of this, that was in an elementary school library and the school or the school district determined that was more appropriate to be in the middle school library. So they moved it,” DeSantis said at a parent-educators association homeschool convention in Orlando. DeSantis accused the mainstream media of spreading a “hoax.” “The media, when they talk about ‘book ban’, understand that is a hoax. They are creating a false narrative,” he said. “These legacy media outlets are … trying to create a political narrative that is totally divorced from the facts and if they’re going to do something like this ridiculous poem hoax and actually put that out there and think that you’re going to believe it, they’re insulting your intelligence and our country.” The Florida governor suggested that parents such as Salinas are protecting children from a “ideological agenda.” “They don’t want the parents involved in education because they view you as an impediment to their ideological agenda,” he said. “They view you as an impediment to their ability to indoctrinate kids with their beliefs and their agendas. I’m sorry, I choose our beliefs as parents over the beliefs of the ideological left. “We want parents to be armed with the ability to make sure their kids are in a safe environment, and yet you have narrative, and you have the left trying to jam this in.” Read the full article here.

        "text": "© Provided by The Associated Press FILE — This March 28, 2017 photo, provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry, shows Jeffrey Epstein. Nearly four years after Epstein died in jail in New York, the AP has obtained more than 4,000 pages of documents related to his death from the Bureau of Prisons under the Freedom of Information Law. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — Two weeks before ending his life, Jeffrey Epstein sat in the corner of his Manhattan jail cell with his hands over his ears, desperate to muffle the sound of a toilet that wouldn’t stop running.  Epstein was agitated and unable to sleep, jail officials observed in records newly obtained by The Associated Press. He called himself a “coward” and complained he was struggling to adapt to life behind bars following his July 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges — his life of luxury reduced to a concrete and steel cage.  The disgraced financier was under psychological observation at the time for a suicide attempt just days earlier that left his neck bruised and scraped. Yet, even after a 31-hour stint on suicide watch, Epstein insisted he wasn't suicidal, telling a jail psychologist he had a “wonderful life” and “would be crazy” to end it.  On Aug. 10, 2019, Epstein was dead.  Nearly four years later, the AP has obtained more than 4,000 pages of documents related to Epstein’s death from the federal Bureau of Prisons under the Freedom of Information Act. They include a detailed psychological reconstruction of the events leading to Epstein's suicide, as well as his health history, internal agency reports, emails and memos and other records.  Taken together, the documents the AP obtained Thursday provide the most complete accounting to date of Epstein's detention and death, and its chaotic aftermath. The records help to dispel the many conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's suicide, underscoring how fundamental failings at the Bureau of Prisons — including severe staffing shortages and employees cutting corners — contributed to Epstein's death.  © Provided by The Associated Press FILE — This image provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement shows financier Jeffrey Epstein, July 25, 2013. Nearly four years after Epstein died in jail in New York, the AP has obtained more than 4,000 pages of documents related to his death from the Bureau of Prisons under the Freedom of Information Law. (Florida Department of Law Enforcement via AP, File)  They shed new light on the federal prison agency's muddled response after Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at the now-shuttered Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City.  In one email, a prosecutor involved in Epstein's criminal case complained about a lack of information from the Bureau of Prisons in the critical hours after his death, writing that it was “frankly unbelievable” that the agency was issuing public press releases \"before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family.”  In another email, a high-ranking Bureau of Prisons official made a spurious suggestion to the agency’s director that news reporters must have been paying jail employees for information about Epstein’s death because they were reporting details of the agency’s failings — impugning the ethics of journalists and the agency's own workers.  The documents also provide a fresh window into Epstein's behavior during his 36 days in jail, including his previously unreported attempt to connect by mail with another high-profile pedophile: Larry Nassar, the U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of athletes.  Epstein's letter to Nassar was found returned to sender in the jail’s mail room weeks after Epstein’s death. “It appeared he mailed it out and it was returned back to him,\" the investigator who found the letter told a prison official by email. \"I am not sure if I should open it or should we hand it over to anyone?”  The letter itself was not included among the documents turned over to the AP.  The night before Epstein’s death, he excused himself from a meeting with his lawyers to make a telephone call to his family. According to a memo from a unit manager, Epstein told a jail employee that he was calling his mother, who’d been dead for 15 years at that point.  Epstein's death put increased scrutiny on the Bureau of Prisons and led the agency to close the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 2021. It spurred an AP investigation that has uncovered deep, previously unreported problems within the agency, the Justice Department’s largest with more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates and an $8 billion annual budget.  An internal memo, undated but sent after Epstein’s death, attributed problems at the jail to “seriously reduced staffing levels, improper or lack of training, and follow up and oversight.” The memo also detailed steps the Bureau of Prisons has taken to remedy lapses Epstein’s suicide exposed, including requiring supervisors to review surveillance video to ensure officers made required cell checks.  Epstein’s lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said people detained at the facility endured “medieval conditions of confinement that no American defend that should have been subjected to.”  “It’s sad, it’s tragic that it took this kind of event to finally cause the Bureau of Prisons to close this regrettable institution,” Weinberg said Thursday in a telephone interview.  The workers tasked with guarding Epstein the night he killed himself, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged with lying on prison records to make it seem as though they had made their required checks before Epstein was found lifeless. Epstein’s cellmate did not return after a court hearing the day before, and prison officials failed to pair another prisoner with him, leaving him alone.  Prosecutors alleged they were sitting at their desks just 15 feet (4.6 meters) from Epstein’s cell, shopped online for furniture and motorcycles, and walked around the unit’s common area instead of making required rounds every 30 minutes.  During one two-hour period, both appeared to have been asleep, according to their indictment. Noel and Thomas admitted to falsifying the log entries but avoided prison time under a deal with federal prosecutors. Copies of some of those logs were included among the documents released Thursday, with the guards' signatures redacted.  Another investigation, by the Justice Department’s inspector general, is still ongoing.  Epstein arrived at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on July 6, 2019. He spent 22 hours in the jail's general population before officials moved him to the special housing unit “due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among the inmate population,” according to the psychological reconstruction of his death.  Epstein later said he was upset about having to wear an orange jumpsuit provided to inmates in the special housing unit and complained about being treated like he was a “bad guy” despite being well behaved behind bars. He requested a brown uniform for his near-daily visits with his lawyers.  During an initial health screening, the 66-year-old said that he had 10-plus female sexual partners within the previous five years. Medical records showed he was suffering from sleep apnea, constipation, hypertension, lower back pain and prediabetes and had been previously treated for chlamydia.  Epstein did make some attempts to adapt to his jailhouse surroundings, the records show. He signed up for a Kosher meal and told prison officials, through his lawyer, that he wanted permission to exercise outside. Two days before he was found dead, Epstein bought $73.85 worth of items from the prison commissary, including an AM/FM radio and headphones. He had $566 left in his account when he died.  Epstein's outlook worsened when a judge denied him bail on July 18, 2019 — raising the prospect that he'd remain locked up until trial and, possibly longer. If convicted, he faced up to 45 years prison. Four days later, Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck.  Epstein survived. His injuries didn't require going to the hospital. He was placed on suicide watch and, later, psychiatric observation. Jail officers noted in logs that they observed him, “sitting at the edge of the bed, lost in thought,” and sitting “with his head against the wall.”  Epstein expressed frustration with the noise of the jail and his lack of sleep. His first few weeks at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Epstein didn't have his sleep apnea breathing apparatus he used. Then, the toilet in his cell started acting up.  “He was still left in the same cell with a broken toilet,\" the jail's chief psychologist wrote in a email the next day. \"Please move him to the cell next door when he returns from legal as the toilet still does not work.”  The day before Epstein ended his life, a federal judge unsealed about 2,000 pages of documents in a sexual abuse lawsuit against him. That development, prison officials observed, further eroded Epstein's previous elevated status.  That, combined with a lack of significant interpersonal connections and \"the idea of potentially spending his life in prison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide,” officials wrote.  __  Associated Press writers Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland, Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia, Sam Metz in Salt Lake City, Jake Offenhartz and David B.

Jean Carroll after she amended her 2019 defamation lawsuit to include the former president's attacks at this month's CNN town hall.  Carroll's Monday filing followed Trump's continued denial of her sexual assault and defamation allegations, even after a jury found the ex-president liable for both counts on May 9. The columnist is seeking further damages in addition to the $5 million she was awarded earlier this month.  During a CNN town hall appearance only a day after being found liable, Trump repudiated Carroll's claims, calling her a \"wack job\" and referring to the case as \"a rigged deal.\"  \"This conduct supports a very substantial punitive damages award in Carroll's favor both to punish Trump, to deter him from engaging in further defamation, and to deter others from doing the same,\" the filing says.  NBC reported that the newly refined suit seeks a total of at least $10 million in damages as well as additional \"punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial.\"  \"I don't know E. Jean Carroll,\" Trump wrote in a Tuesday Truth Social post. \"I never met her or touched her ￼(except on a celebrity line with her African American husband who she disgustingly called the \"Ape,\"), I wouldn't want to know or touch her, I never abused her or raped her or took her to a dressing room 25 years ago in a crowded department store where the doors are LOCKED, she has no idea when, or did anything else to her, except deny her Fake, Made Up Story, that she wrote in a book. IT NEVER HAPPENED, IS A TOTAL SCAM, UNFAIR TRIAL!\"  Trump also argued that the Carroll case had a distinctly political motivation, writing that it was \"part of the Democrats playbook to tarnish my name and person, much like the now fully debunked Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, the 51 Intelligence Agents, FBI/Twitter Files, and so much more.\"  \"It is being funded and tried by Democrat operatives, although this was denied by them, and when they got caught in the lie, the Clinton appointed judge would not let us use it in trial,\" he continued. \"Time will prove him to be highly partisan & very unfair.

        "text": "80 per cent of single parent households in the US are headed by a mother  Single moms are sharing their experience of life in a mommune on social media  One household has even signed a deal with a TV producer for a reality show  Single mothers are joining forces under one roof to share the load of household bills and childcare responsibilities.  These arrangements, dubbed 'mommunes', are cropping up across America, with women taking to social media to share their experiences of moving in together.  Kristin Batykefer's marriage fell apart last year and she lost her job - leaving her with no income and nowhere to go.  Two friends took her, and her daughter who is now four, into their home near Jacksonville, Florida. Not long after Batykefer's best friend Tessa Gilder went through a divorce and she also moved in with her two kids - now ages five and one.  Now 32-year-old Batykefer shares her 'mommune' life with her 45,000 followers - as the women pool resources to bring up their families.  © Provided by Daily Mail Kristin Batykefer (right) and Tessa Gilder (left) live in a mommune with their three children  In 2022, there were 10.9 million one-parent families with a child under 18 years old in the US, per the US Census Bureau.  Of these single-parent families, 80 per cent were headed by a mother.  Batykefer told The New York Times: 'When I had to leave my husband, all I could think about was how I now had to figure out how to do everything on my own — buy a house on my own, pay my bills on my own, and raise my child on my own.  'I never thought about finding another single mother to live with and do it together. We just fell into it. But now, it’s like, why isn’t it more common for us to join forces?'  Batykefer, whose divorce was finalized in February and now splits custody of her daughter with her ex-husband, is grateful that Gilder's daughter is the same age so the kids always have someone to play with.  She uses her social media presence to document how the women split childcare responsibilities for the three children living in the house.  In a TikTok post to her 38,000 followers, Batykefer detailed how when she came down with an illness, the other three women in the house made her cookies from scratch and homemade vegetable soup, and took her kids to the park so she could rest and recuperate.  'This is your sign to move into a mommune,' she wrote.  She also gives advice to others, and encourages them to start their own so-called mommune.  In another video she said: 'If you're a single mom I would say find another single mom that you align with in values and then talk to her about it.'  Batykefer also shows the perks of living with other women - which mean she is able to visit the beach and go to concerts without worrying about the childcare responsibilities that come with single parenthood.  Batykefer and Gilder have also signed a deal with a television producer for a reality show.  They are currently living still in the four-bedroom home near Jacksonville, but hope to use any funds from the show to buy and remodel a fixer-upper of their own in the coming year.  < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > Batykefer uses social media to document how the women split childcare responsibilities © Provided by Daily Mail  The women are not alone in their arrangement - and the set-up certainly isn't a novel idea.  Mothers, particularly those in nonwhite communities, have been house-sharing for centuries.  But as many people experienced a restructuring of their living situation during the pandemic, a new light has been shed on households with non-traditional living structures.  Grace Bastidas, editor in chief of Parents.com, told The New York Times: 'In Latino cultures, there’s this idea of a co-mother — a person who supports you and helps you raise your children.  'At the height of the pandemic, we all started creating these pods of people, so this is just another iteration of that type of partnership.'  She continued: 'We were told it takes a village, but it’s not always there, and single moms especially are juggling rising costs of living and reduced child care options.  'This is part of the larger trend of parents stretching traditional boundaries of what a family is, and taking matters into their own hands to find creative solutions.'  Last year, Holly Harper, from Washington, D.C. detailed how she bought a four-unit apartment building with her friend Herrin Hopper after separating from her partner of 17 years in 2018 and selling their family home.  She said the the arrangement is a 'kid paradise.'  < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > Batykefer now splits custody of her daughter with her ex-husband © Provided by Daily Mail  In an essay published by Insider she explained that she knew it would be impossible to find a duplex or condo in the area on her 'self-employed, single-mom budget,' but she wanted to own something as an investment.  'To be able to do this, I found another single mom with the same needs as mine — space, comfort, a home — to live with,' she wrote. 'It's been a life changer for not only us but also our children.'  Harper, who has one daughter, said she has always craved a familial community like the ones she's seen on her favorite television programs. After her divorce, she 'vowed to be open to unique opportunities' — and, in this case, a unique living arrangement.  In a twist of fate, one of her closest friends not only separated from her husband around the same that she got divorced, but she also shared her 'commune dream.'  However, they didn't take the decision lightly. Harper explained that they approached the arrangement 'like choosing a platonic spouse.'<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nSingle mothers in the US are joining forces to form 'mommunes' to share the load of household bills and childcare responsibilities. \nKristin Batykefer and Tessa Gilder have signed a deal with a TV producer for a reality show about their 'mommune' life. \nHolly Harper bought a four-unit apartment building with her friend Herrin Hopper to create a 'kid paradise'. \nMothers, particularly those in nonwhite communities, have been house-sharing for centuries.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the growing trend of 'mommunes', where single mothers join forces to share the load of household bills and childcare responsibilities.\nIt follows the story of Kristin Batykefer and Tessa Gilder, two single mothers who moved in together with their three children and have since signed a deal with a TV producer for a reality show.\nThe article also highlights the long-standing tradition of house-sharing in nonwhite communities, and how the pandemic has shed a new light on households with non-traditional living structures."

        "text": "© Provided by Salon John Durham; Bill BarrPhoto illustration by Salon/Getty Images  After four years and millions of taxpayer dollars, special counsel John Durham, appointed by former Attorney General Bill Barr, has released his report. To be precise, the current attorney general, Merrick Garland, released the report, unexpurgated, unredacted and without comment or commentary. Durham is (or was) the independent counsel Barr appointed to conduct the investigation into the investigation by Robert Mueller, himself an independent counsel appointed under Barr's predecessor Jeff Sessions, into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election, among other things. The report the Durham team issued amounts to more than 300 pages of … well, not much of anything. Some criticisms of the FBI, most of which, according to FBI sources, had already been addressed. But no smoking gun, no vast Hillary Clinton-led liberal plot to undermine the Trump presidency.  What it did do, however, was to return our gaze back to Bill Barr, the instigator of this apparent waste of time and money. Back in January of this year — a lifetime in the Trump universe — revelations about Barr and his conduct as attorney general of the United States, an office he has held under two presidents, were back in the news, interrupting Barr's latest attempts to rehabilitate himself and his image.  In a Jan. 26 article in the New York Times, Charlie Savage, Adam Goldman and Katie Benner analyzed the relationship between Barr and Durham. Among the many transgressions catalogued are Barr's regular meetings with Durham, dinners, drinks, travels abroad together to gather information that was supposedly part of Durham's \"independent\" investigation, statements by Barr mischaracterizing the investigation and, among other things, contradicting the conclusions of the Department of Justice's own inspector general. All of these were seemingly purposeful failures to clear up the confused reportage around the entire mess. And although it was obvious long before the 2020 election that the Durham investigation had turned up nothing substantial, Barr waited until after the election to admit it. As it turns out, independent counsel No. 2 was not so independent.  Based on Barr's prior behavior, his conduct with Durham should have come as no surprise. Perhaps luckily for Barr, it was quickly eclipsed as a news item by the constant stream of juicier Trump-related matters: indictment in New York, looming indictments in Georgia and possibly elsewhere, Jan. 6-related convictions, revelations in the Dominion defamation lawsuit against Fox and, most recently, the E. Jean Carroll sexual assault and defamation case and its verdict in Carroll's favor. Not to mention the still-unfolding allegations in the litigation brought by Noelle Dunphy against Trump crony Rudy Giuliani, who was, for a moment, \"America's mayor.\" Dunphy alleges, among other things, the sale of presidential pardons to benefit Giuliani and Trump (an allegation that reportedly elicited a wan \"I don't know\" from Barr).  I have written about Barr for Salon before, but that was before his latest attempts to \"rehabilitate\" himself. And before the extent of his relationship to John Durham was uncovered. Let's take a few minutes to review how we got here.  In the words of former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the presidential appointee at the top of the Justice Department is supposed to be an \"independent proponent of the rule of law.\" But the position of attorney general is, and likely has always been, a challenging one for a lawyer. It is full of conflicts, contradictions, divided loyalties and overlapping jurisdictions, as well as rife with separation of powers issues and a heavy dose of partisan politics, among other things. At the outset (the position was created in 1789), the attorney general was to be a part-time lawyer whose job was to advise others in government on the legality of their proposed actions or positions, and to represent the United States before the Supreme Court. But the client of the attorney general was and is not the president. Rather, the client is the United States of America itself.  How is the attorney general to function as an \"independent proponent of the rule of law\" while also a political appointee, hired by the president, one whose duties extend to the political, to policy, in their function as a member of the executive branch, and to law enforcement? The Supreme Court has acknowledged in another context the inherent difficulty of having the president control the appointment (and dismissal) of the attorney general. Thus the seeds of the mess we find ourselves in today were sown.  Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.  Attorneys general have had close personal and professional relationships with the presidents who appointed them since the first attorney general, Edmund Randolph, appointed by George Washington. Randolph was well-known to Washington; in fact, he was Washington's former aide-de-camp and his lawyer, as well as lawyer to other prominent Virginians. Roger Brooks Taney, who served as attorney general for two years during the presidency of Andrew Jackson, and later as chief justice of the Supreme Court, was known as a Jackson crony. Henry Stanbury, the attorney general under Andrew Johnson, resigned to lead the defense team in Johnson's impeachment trial, as did his successor, William Maxwell Evarts. Skipping forward a century, John F. Kennedy's choice for attorney general was his brother, Bobby, Nixon's choice was his law partner, John Mitchell, Reagan's choices were both close associates from his days in California politics, including the scandal-ridden Edwin Meese. And those are just a few examples.  The issues get particularly gnarly when controversies involve the president or the president's senior staff and advisers, as was the case with Andrew Johnson's impeachment as well as Watergate, Iran-Contra, Whitewater or the several and proliferating scandals around Donald Trump and his inner circle.  Attorneys general since the Carter administration have promulgated rules limiting interactions between the DOJ and the other departments in the executive branch, the White House and Congress. The various AGs under Trump adopted no such rules.  After Watergate and Nixon's resignation, Congress moved to address this issue with the Ethics in Government Act, providing for the appointment of a special prosecutor, later denominated an independent counsel, to be appointed by a panel of federal judges at the request of the attorney general. After that statute lapsed, the Department of Justice adopted regulations providing for the appointment of a \"special counsel\" in specific cases, including several of those mentioned. The appointment (or dismissal) of such a counsel itself became both a legal and political issue, as in the now infamous \"Saturday Night Massacre\" of 1973 and again both with Trump's repeated threats against Mueller and Barr's appointment of Durham.  Short of the appointment of an independent counsel, attorneys general since 1979 have promulgated rules limiting interactions between the Department of Justice and the other departments in the executive branch, the White House and Congress. The several attorneys general under Trump adopted no such rules, although arguably, the rules in place from the tenures of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch under Barack Obama still applied to such contacts. The rules are mostly common sense cloaked in appropriate legalese and mostly procedural, leaving it to the AG or other senior officers at the DOJ to make case-by-case determinations as to what contacts are permissible. As Garland said in the July 21, 2021, memorandum setting forth the rules for his department, the intent is to ensure \"adherence to the long-standing department norms of independence from inappropriate influences.\"  Robert Mueller was appointed under the Department of Justice regulations to investigate Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election, a move which enraged not only Trump but also Barr, the once and future attorney general. In their view, the Mueller investigation was a \"witch hunt,\" a conspiracy by intelligence and law enforcement agencies and a plot by the \"deep state,\" all somehow masterminded by their favorite bête noire, Hillary Clinton. Barr famously \"summarized\" the conclusions of the Mueller report before its release, inaccurately characterizing the report as a near-total exoneration of Trump. Then, in a move that only a lawyer could love — or only a lawyer of Barr's distinctive type — he appointed Durham as a special counsel literally charged with investigating the investigation.  The fact that Durham found no plot after four years of presumably-diligent digging is not surprising. Based on Barr's past behavior, I suppose his actions during and after the Durham investigation should also not be surprising. He did not even try to conceal his interference. You don't need a dictionary, an Ivy League education or a law degree to see that Barr's conduct undermines the very concept of independence and violates, in the crudest way, the entire purpose of the appointment of an independent counsel. It's about as far as it could possibly get from Ramsey Clark's conception of the attorney general as an independent proponent of the rule of law.  Future attorneys general will, we must hope, once again adhere to the norms established for the office and the duties of lawyers everywhere to serve their clients without improper influence from the outside. Most importantly, they must follow the law, particularly the laws established to ensure that very independence. Bill Barr's legacy has been to undermine all of that, and we must also hope we have heard the last of him. Barr served two presidents, and in some sense he did so faithfully. He failed to serve his primary clients, the people of the United States.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nSpecial counsel John Durham's report released by Attorney General Merrick Garland revealed no substantial evidence of a Hillary Clinton-led plot to undermine the Trump presidency. \nAttorney General Bill Barr had a close relationship with Durham, meeting with him regularly and contradicting the conclusions of the Department of Justice's own inspector general. \nAttorneys general are supposed to be independent proponents of the rule of law, but Barr's conduct undermined this concept. \nFuture attorneys general must adhere to the norms established for the office and follow the laws to ensure independence.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article examines the relationship between former Attorney General Bill Barr and special counsel John Durham, who was appointed by Barr to investigate the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.\nThe report released by Durham's team amounted to more than 300 pages of criticism of the FBI, but no substantial evidence of a Hillary Clinton-led liberal plot to undermine the Trump presidency.\nThe article also looks at Barr's attempts to rehabilitate himself and his image, and how his conduct with Durham was a violation of the purpose of the appointment of an independent counsel.\nIt concludes by noting that Barr failed to serve his primary clients, the people of the United States."

        "text": "© Provided by Salon Donald TrumpPhoto illustration by Salon/Getty Images  Former President Donald Trump admitted to holding onto a classified Pentagon document about a potential attack on Iran, according to an audio recording of a summer 2021 meeting, multiple sources told CNN.  The recording was made at Trump's Bedminster golf club in July 2021, when Trump met with two people working on the autobiography of former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. His aide Margo Martin, who regularly tapes conversations with authors to ensure accuracy, recorded the conversation, CNN reported,  \"This recording is significant because it demonstrates Trump's knowledge of the law governing classified information,\" former U.S. Attorney Barb McQuade, a University of Michigan law professor, told Salon. \"For most crimes, ignorance of the laws is no excuse. Handling classified information is an exception to that rule. Prosecutors must prove the defendant knew his conduct was illegal. A recording of Trump discussing his knowledge of that law would be powerful evidence of this element of the offense.\"  Trump's comments on the recording indicate his desire to share the information, but also reveal that he was aware of the constraints on his authority as a former president to declassify records, two sources told CNN.  It contradicts the former president's repeated claims that he declassified all material he took from the White House, allowing the tape to serve as evidence for prosecutors to establish that Trump was aware he should not possess classified documents.  \"The recording is also valuable because it pertains to national defense information,\" McQuade said. \"For that reason, it is covered not only by statutes regulating classified information, but also under the Espionage Act. If he retained and discussed a document covered by the Espionage Act, then his claims that he declassified the documents become irrelevant. It would still be a crime.\"  Related Trump melts down on Truth Social as his lawyer struggles to defend damning secret recording  Sources described the recording as a crucial piece of evidence that could potentially be used in a case against Trump, according to CNN. Special counsel Jack Smith has given particular attention to the meeting as a component of the criminal probe concerning Trump's handling of national security information.  The audio recording would be a \"blockbuster piece of evidence\" in the special counsel's case against Trump, demonstrating both Trump's knowledge and intent concerning his alleged mishandling of classified documents, said Temidayo Aganga-Williams, partner at Selendy Gay Elsberg and former senior investigative counsel for the House Jan. 6 committee.  \"[T]his recording squarely moves the investigation of President Trump's handling of classified documents from potentially just an obstruction case to squarely an Espionage Act case,\" Aganga-Williams said. \"The Espionage Act makes it a crime to, without authorization, retain documents related to national defense that could be used to harm the United States or aid a foreign adversary or share such information about the same to an unauthorized person.\"  Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.  The recording indicates that prosecutors are not only focusing on Trump's involvement with retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, but they are also examining the events that took place at Bedminster a year prior.  \"Trump's taped conversation, as reported, fatally undermines one of his earliest defenses, that he could declassify national security documents at will,\" former federal prosecutor Kevin O'Brien told Salon. \"No credible person has believed Trump's defense. If reports of the taped conversation are accurate, Trump himself didn't believe it either.\"  He added that the context of Trump's reported remarks is even more interesting since at the time of the alleged conversation, General Mark Milley was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  \"Trump supposedly claims on the tape that the disclosed document contradicts General Milley's assertion that he talked Trump out of invading Iran,\" O'Brien said. \"If true, then the document must have contained extremely sensitive material on the military's possible plans to in fact invade Iran. Few subjects would have been more sensitive than this – and any breach of secrecy regarding it would have threatened national security. This possibility only heightens the seriousness of what Trump appears to have done.\"  Smith, who is spearheading the Justice Department investigation into Trump, is examining the removal of hundreds of classified government documents from the White House which were then taken to Mar-a-Lago after the former president left office.  \"This recording, coupled with other recent revelations, makes it not only reasonable but extremely likely that former President Trump will be charged under the Espionage Act,\" Aganga-Williams said.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFormer President Donald Trump admitted to holding onto a classified Pentagon document about a potential attack on Iran.\nThe recording of Trump's conversation indicates his knowledge of the law governing classified information.\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith is examining Trump's handling of national security information, including the recording from Trump's Bedminster golf club.\nThe recording could be used as evidence in a case against Trump, potentially under the Espionage Act.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses a recording of former President Donald Trump admitting to holding onto a classified Pentagon document about a potential attack on Iran.\nThe recording, made at Trump's Bedminster golf club in July 2021, indicates that Trump was aware of the constraints on his authority as a former president to declassify records.\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith is examining the recording as part of a criminal probe concerning Trump's handling of national security information, and it could potentially be used as evidence in a case against Trump.\nThe recording could demonstrate both Trump's knowledge and intent concerning his alleged mishandling of classified documents, and could potentially lead to charges under the Espionage Act."

        "text": "© Provided by ScienceAlert  The first synthetic substance ever brewed on planet Earth may not have been a product of our own species but was concocted by a close relative as far back as around 200,000 years ago.  Researchers from the University of Tübingen and the State Museum of Prehistory in Germany and Strasbourg University in France recently conducted a complex chemical analysis on Neanderthal artifacts made using birch tar, concluding how it was extracted wasn't incidental.  Birch tar is a sticky black goo used since ancient times for its various adhesive, water-repellent, and even antimicrobial properties. Some of the first early humans who lived in Europe used it to bind parts of their tools together.  The material can be extracted from birch bark using heat, but scientists disagree on whether Neanderthals were purposefully producing the tar or if it was simply a consequence of enjoying a warm fire.  Some think of black tar as a happy accident that Neanderthals simply scraped from surrounding rocks after burning birch bark. Others think the sticky, water-resistant material was carefully crafted in an underground oven long before our species learned the trick.  This might seem like a pedantic squabble, but intentionally distilling useful substances from raw materials is commonly assumed to be another activity that sets human intelligence apart from other species.  Based on the analysis of two pieces of birch tar found at an archaeological site in Germany, this latest study argues that \"birch tar may document advanced technology, forward planning, and cultural capacity in Neanderthals.\"  An analysis of the artifacts' chemistry suggests they were deprived of oxygen during their formation. This low-oxygen profile could, theoretically, be achieved in a few ways, so researchers tested the various methods.  Two of the methods burned birch bark above ground, while three involved an underground oven of sorts.  Burning birch bark above ground allowed the tar to condense on the tops of stones in the open air or a dome of sticks. The below-ground methods essentially meant burying rolled birch bark under a fire.  © Provided by ScienceAlert The two pieces of birch tar (a) and the five methods (b-f) tested to extract birch tar. (Schmidt et al., The two pieces of birch tar (a) and the five methods (b-f) tested to extract birch tar. (Schmidt et al., Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences , 2023)  Ultimately, only birch tar made below ground carried the same chemical signature as the ancient artifacts found in Germany.  The findings suggest Neanderthal tar is not the fortuitous \"result of unintentional processes in open-air fires\" but a complex underground technique that had to be carefully planned, as it could not be monitored once it was buried.  Such a complex setup would have required a specific recipe to be followed precisely. Researchers say the practice was probably invented through trial and error, with gradual improvements adding up over time.  If Neanderthals really were making tar as far back as 200,000 years, that beats any evidence of Homo sapiens making tar by 100,000 years.  \"Thus,\" researchers write, \"what we show here for the first time is that Neanderthals invented and refined a transformative technique, most likely independently of the influence from Homo sapiens.\"  Previous discoveries have shown that Neanderthals had complex diets involving multiple food preparation steps. Their use of fire, however, may not have been confined to heating or cooking.  The intelligence of our earlier cousins should not be underestimated any longer.  The study was published in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nResearchers have concluded that Neanderthals were producing birch tar as far back as 200,000 years ago.\nThis tar was produced using a complex underground technique that required careful planning.\nThis discovery suggests that Neanderthals had a higher level of intelligence than previously thought.\nThis beats any evidence of Homo sapiens making tar by 100,000 years.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses a recent study that suggests Neanderthals were the first to brew a synthetic substance, birch tar, around 200,000 years ago.\nThe study found that the tar was made using a complex underground technique that required careful planning and likely developed over time through trial and error.\nThis discovery suggests that Neanderthals had a higher level of intelligence than previously thought and may have been the first to use transformative techniques."

        "text": "© Provided by The Cool Down Fast EV Gemini battery  The Gemini battery from manufacturer Our Next Energy (ONE) promises to give electric vehicles a greater range than ever before.  In a December 2021 road test, ONE’s first Gemini prototype was able to power a Tesla Model S for an incredible 752 miles across Michigan on a single charge, according to the company’s website.  A third party validated the impressive results using a vehicle dynamometer.  Cars that rely on electricity offer numerous benefits. They’re quieter than traditional combustion engine models, they’re convenient to charge at an at-home EV charging station, and they don’t produce any exhaust fumes that contribute to air pollution.  However, it’s been difficult to drive long distances in an EV because the batteries could only hold a limited electrical charge, and charging stations were difficult to find on the road.  These problems stopped some potential users from making the switch to electric despite all the benefits.  Now, as more advanced batteries like Gemini hit the market and charging stations become more common, the range of EVs has increased dramatically, making it easier than ever to choose to invest in an EV. The more that people switch to EVs, the quieter our roads and cleaner our air will be.  Besides being more efficient, Gemini is more environmentally friendly to produce than past EV batteries. According to ONE, it uses almost 20% less lithium than earlier models, and 60% less graphite, so it takes less mining to produce each battery. Reduced mining activity means reduced pollution.  If you’re interested in an EV with Gemini, watch for upcoming changes to the iX electric SUV from BMW. ONE announced that the iX with Gemini is expected to roll out soon with an estimated range of 965 kilometers, or almost 600 miles.  Baris Guzel, a partner at BMW i Ventures, is optimistic about the partnership, saying, “Our Next Energy is working to fundamentally reinvent the battery while focusing on sustainability, safety, and cost; three key factors which will help speed the development and adoption of battery electric vehicles.”  © Provided by The Cool Down  Join our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovationsand<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nOur Next Energy's Gemini battery promises to give electric vehicles a greater range than ever before, with a Tesla Model S able to travel 752 miles on a single charge.\nThis makes it easier than ever to switch to an EV, and the battery is also more environmentally friendly to produce.\nBMW's upcoming iX electric SUV with Gemini is expected to have a range of 965 kilometers, or almost 600 miles.\nThis partnership between BMW and Our Next Energy is expected to speed up the development and adoption of battery electric vehicles.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nOur Next Energy's Gemini battery promises to give electric vehicles a greater range than ever before.\nEVs offer numerous benefits such as being quieter and more convenient to charge.\nGemini is more environmentally friendly to produce than past EV batteries.\nBMW's iX electric SUV with Gemini is expected to roll out soon with an estimated range of 600 miles."

        "text": "© Provided by NBC News  In late April, Juliet Harvey-Bolia, a Republican New Hampshire state representative, was one of dozens of elected officials whose endorsements former President Donald Trump announced at a packed rally in Manchester.  On Tuesday, officials at Never Back Down, the super PAC backing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, said Harvey-Bolia is throwing her support to their guy. She is one of four New Hampshire legislators — the others are Reps. Brian Cole, Lisa Smart and Debra DiSimone — whom Never Back Down identified as flipping from Trump to DeSantis as it rolled out endorsements from 51 lawmakers in the state who signed a pledge to back DeSantis.  But that’s not how Harvey-Bolia sees it.  “I’m endorsing both,” she said in a telephone interview. “DeSantis has a lot of promise for the future, and Trump is great now.”  The unusual dual endorsements added an intriguing twist when DeSantis is trying to show he is building momentum as he nears making his bid official. Last week, his super PAC revealed endorsements from 37 Iowa legislators just before he launched a three-city tour of the state.  And NBC News confirmed Tuesday that he has summoned his top donors to meetings in Miami on May 25 in conjunction with his expected campaign launch.  DeSantis’ team expects more than 100 donors and other supporters to attend a briefing with him and his senior team, said a person familiar with the plans.  But Harvey-Bolia’s ambivalence also points to an intense behind-the-scenes battle for endorsements — and the immense pressure on lawmakers to avoid making an enemy in the eventual nominee — as Trump and DeSantis jockey for position. The three other New Hampshire Republicans who endorsed Trump in April and DeSantis on Tuesday didn’t return calls seeking comment for this story.  The Trump campaign also didn't immediately return a request for comment.  Still, DeSantis’ allies say there’s excitement for him in the early-voting states and those that hold primaries later on next year’s calendar. Iowa and New Hampshire are of outsize importance in the Republican nominating fight because their caucuses and primary are the first two contests.  “I think you get a sense from what you saw in Iowa over the weekend that those legislative endorsements are indicative of what we’re seeing and feeling on the ground,” said a Never Back Down strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss political machinations. “And I think what you’re seeing and feeling on the ground in New Hampshire is going to be very similar.”  DeSantis, whose poll numbers have flatlined in recent months, has an uphill battle to supplant Trump, the two-time GOP nominee, as the party’s standard-bearer. In the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, Trump stands at 55% and DeSantis at 21%. Public surveys of Iowa caucus-goers and New Hampshire voters show Trump in the lead in each state.  DeSantis allies say the endorsements in Iowa and New Hampshire are just the beginning of their effort to close the gap and win the nomination.  “This is about building a movement,” the Never Back Down strategist said. “This is about building an organization to win. And so this is just one step in the process. It’s not the end game.” <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFormer President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are vying for the Republican nomination for the upcoming election.\nNew Hampshire state representative Juliet Harvey-Bolia has endorsed both candidates, while three other New Hampshire legislators have flipped from Trump to DeSantis.\nDeSantis' super PAC, Never Back Down, has revealed endorsements from 51 lawmakers in the state who signed a pledge to back DeSantis.\nDeSantis is trying to build momentum as he nears making his bid official, and his team expects more than 100 donors and other supporters to attend a briefing with him and his senior team.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFormer President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are vying for the Republican nomination for the 2024 election. \nFour New Hampshire legislators have endorsed both Trump and DeSantis. \nDeSantis' super PAC has announced endorsements from 51 lawmakers in New Hampshire and 37 in Iowa. \nDeSantis is expected to launch his campaign on May 25 with a briefing for over 100 donors and supporters."

Republicans have repeatedly pushed corruption allegations against the Bidens that have frustrated even Fox News hosts. \"You don't have any facts,\" host Steve Doocy told Comer last week.  Fox News host Maria Bartiromo pressed Comer on the evidence on Sunday.  \"You also spoke with an informant who gave you all of this information,\" she said. \"Where is that informant today?

The whistleblower is very credible.\"  Comer added that \"no president has ever been accused of the things that the Biden family's been accused of.\"  \"Hold on a second, Congressman. Did you just say that the whistleblower or the informant is now missing?\" Bartiromo interjected.  \"Well, we're hopeful that we can find the informant,\" Comer said. \"Remember, these informants are kind of in the spy business, so they don't make a habit of being seen a lot or being high profile or anything like that.\"  Comer added that nine of the 10 informants \"that we've identified that have very good knowledge with respect to the Bidens, they're one of three things.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  Russian President Vladimir Putin has done wonders for NATO. He has united the alliance in a manner not seen since the Cold War. Moreover, were it not for his invasion of Ukraine, neither Finland nor Sweden would likely have applied to join the alliance. Finland has become a member; Sweden may join now that Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been reelected president of Turkey.  Erdogan no longer needs to play to the anti-Kurdish impulses of the country’s extreme nationalists, whose party leader threw his support behind him during the second round of elections. Some NATO officials speculate that Erdogan will reverse course on Sweden in time for the alliance’s Vilnius summit. That may be too optimistic, but Stockholm’s accession sometime this summer is more than likely.  Yet Putin’s gifts to NATO may not yet be done. Ireland is actually debating whether to join the alliance. That’s a remarkable development in a country that fiercely defended its neutrality in the war against Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, Dublin no longer feels that pure neutrality is a viable policy. It is deeply concerned that Russia could at some point cut the trans-Atlantic cables that are critical to its information systems and its economy.  Such a fear has been repeatedly voiced by British military leaders, notably when Admiral Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of the defence staff, asserted shortly before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that the Russian underwater program could “put at risk and potentially exploit” the undersea cables that provide the world’s information system.  Actually, Ireland has already confronted Russia in the very recent past. In mid-January 2022, Moscow announced that the following month its Northern Fleet would conduct a major exercise about 150 miles off the Irish coast. Given the timing of the drill — just weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine — it appeared that it was meant to intimidate Britain, so that London would not take a strong stance against the impending Russian military campaign.  The Russian announcement alarmed the Irish government, which sought and failed to persuade Moscow from going ahead with the exercise. A group of fishermen from County Cork took the matter into their own hands, however. They announced that their boats would maintain a continuous presence in the vicinity of the exercise, thereby interfering with the Russian fleet’s activities. A few days after the fishermen publicized their plan, Moscow backed off and moved the exercise elsewhere.  Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, made clear in the past several days that NATO membership is not on the table. Of course, that was the position of Sweden and Finland before they applied for membership. Yet even if Ireland is not about to apply for a seat, it has unambiguously signaled that it wishes to become a more active player in Europe’s efforts to resist Russian aggression.  Ireland’s membership in the European Union already commits it under Article 42.7 of the EU Treaty to come to the aid of any member state that is the victim of an attack. In addition, Ireland is a member of NATO’s Partnership for Peace (PfP). Although most of its activities as a NATO partner have thus far focused on peacekeeping, under the mantle of the PfP Ireland has also worked closely with NATO in counter-IED (improvised explosive device) training and it has joined NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, based in Estonia.  Given its concern about Atlantic undersea cables, Ireland will likely participate in NATO’s newly created, Brussels-based Critical Undersea Infrastructure Co-ordination Cell. Indeed, Prime Minister Varadkar just announced that he would give “deep consideration” to any EU or NATO effort to protect the undersea cables, saying “because we are an island nation, our seas are seven times greater than our land area and going through those seas are a lot of really important infrastructure, communications cables that connect Ireland to the world and Europe to North America and also, for example, our gas interconnector with the UK and our electricity interconnectors both with the UK and new one with France.”  Yet PfP provides even more scope for Dublin to deepen its relationship with both NATO and the United States in particular, much as Finland and Sweden have done over the past decade. Any Irish effort to enhance its military ties with America would certainly be welcome in Washington, and not only because President Joe Biden is of Irish descent.  The Irish public currently is nearly evenly split on the question of joining NATO. Yet in light of the sudden shift in both Swedish and Finnish public support for NATO membership, a larger segment of the Irish public may also begin push for entry into the alliance, especially if Russia continues to pursue its murderous campaign in Ukraine. And were Dublin ever to apply for NATO membership, Americans in general and the Senate in particular (which would vote on accession) would welcome Ireland with open arms.  Dov S. Zakheim is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and vice chairman of the board for the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  As a resident of Pennsylvania, I am still trying to understand how John Fetterman was elected to the Senate. It amazes me that he could win the Democratic primary in the state and then defeat the Republican candidate, Mehmet Oz.  Since being elected, he has done nothing to change my opinion on this. And, when he decided to appear at a Senate press conference on Thursday wearing shorts and a hoodie, it confirmed everything I thought about him when he was a candidate.  AT G-7, BIDEN MUST UNDERLINE URGENCY OF CHINA CONCERN  John Fetterman is an embarrassing slob.  Much has been made about Fetterman's health conditions, and there are definitely valid concerns. From the stroke he suffered during his campaign to his extended medical leave after he took office, many have questioned whether Fetterman was fit for the job. These are medical issues and are mainly out of Fetterman's control.  He can, however, can control his appearance. He has just repeatedly refused to do so. That may work on the campaign trail; it should not work as a senator from Pennsylvania.  As a senator, wearing shorts and a hoodie during an official press conference is beneath the dignity of the office. Standards are important and exist for a reason. Furthermore, it's something that wouldn't be tolerated at any other job. No employer in the country would have allowed their employee to work had they worn what Fetterman did on Thursday.  Fetterman's clothing would have been out of line even at a gym, health club, or fitness center. He should be ashamed of himself, and so should the Democrats who said nothing and tolerated his slovenliness. They continue to enable and facilitate the decline of our country.  To her credit, congresswoman Lauren Boebert (R-CO) scolded Fetterman for his appearance and seeming lack of respect for his job. It was a sentiment that everyone in Congress — Democrat and Republican — should follow.  \"John Fetterman redefined Casual Friday on a Thursday morning,\" Boebert tweeted. \"It's truly unbecoming for someone to show up like that to any job, let alone a job that only 100 people are elected to do. There's just no excuse for it.\"  Boebert is absolutely correct. Fetterman must honor and respect the office he was (shockingly) elected to and should be held accountable when he fails to do so. Wearing shorts and a hoodie at Thursday's press conference is the stuff of satires and parodies, not the actions of elected U.S. Senators.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  It's one thing for him to be unable to perform his job duties because of his health; it's another thing entirely for him to blatantly ignore and disregard the minimal dignity of being a senator.  He can be a slob on his own time with his wife and children. When he is in the Senate, he must exhibit some dignity. If he can't, replace him with someone who can.

        "text": "© KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images A security guard stands at the door of Trump Tower in New York on March 7, 2021. The inclusion of a book by a former Trump Tower doorman in a list of witness testimony presented to the grand jury in Donald Trump's criminal investigation has prompted questions about its significance in the prosecution's case. In April, Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection to alleged hush money payments made during the 2016 election campaign. He is the first former president to face criminal charges in U.S. history. It follows an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg over Trump's alleged involvement in payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels by his then-lawyer Michael Cohen. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, claimed to have been paid $130,000 by Cohen to stay quiet about an alleged affair with Trump in 2006. Cohen has previously said he was reimbursed by Trump. Trump has denied having sexual relations with Daniels along with any financial wrongdoing. The case against Trump claims that he used payments through associates to individuals who could have hurt his electoral chances during the 2016 presidential election and did not properly disclose the payments in election filings or tax returns. A list of publications released on Friday includes books by Cohen, Daniels and several by Trump himself. However, it also includes Trump Doorman, a 2019 book written by Dino Sajudin, who according to Bragg's statement of facts in the case against Trump was paid $30,000 by American Media Inc. (AMI) for the exclusive rights. In the book, Sajudin alleged that Trump had a child out of wedlock with a concierge at Trump Tower—a claim both the woman and Trump have denied to various outlets. According to Bragg, in November 2015, David Pecker, then AMI's CEO, learned that Sajudin was attempting to sell the information, and at his direction, the company signed an agreement that led to the payment. \"AMI falsely characterized this payment in AMI's books and records, including in its general ledger,\" Bragg alleged. He added that after AMI concluded that the story was untrue, an unnamed lawyer \"instructed\" Pecker not to release Sajudin from the agreement until after the election. \"I don't know why Mr. Sajudin's book is on the Manhattan DA's discovery list, but I sure would like to find out,\" Lisa Rubin, a former lawyer and legal analyst for MSNBC, tweeted, noting that the book \"really popped [out] for me.\" \"Watch this space,\" she added. While the allegations contained in the book are by both Bragg's and Trump's account false, the payment of $30,000 by AMI could be used by the prosecution in an attempt to demonstrate a policy of suppressing stories that may have been damaging to Trump during his first White House bid—a practice known as \"catch and kill\"—regardless of their veracity. Pecker, who was until August 2020 publisher of various titles including National Enquirer, has been described as a friend and ally of Trump. In 2018, AMI admitted to paying Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, $150,000 to remain quiet about an affair with Trump—a decision it said was made \"in concert\" with Trump's presidential campaign, Reuters reported. Cohen also pleaded guilty to his role in this payment. Newsweek approached Pecker via email and the office of the Manhattan district attorney via direct message for comment on Monday. At a hearing in Manhattan on May 23, Judge Juan Merchan set a date of March 25 next year for the start of the criminal trial, with a further hearing to take place in October this year.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to resign her seat after her return to Washington following a prolonged absence due to shingles.  Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) argued lawmakers should resign if they become “a shadow of your former self.”  “I think if you’re a member, and you become a shadow of your former self, you should resign,” Torres told Insider this week, calling for Feinstein to step aside for the first time. “Once you’re no longer the best person to represent your state, you have a duty to move on.”  Torres joins Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) in calling for Feinstein to leave the upper chamber.  Feinstein, 89, has had a distinguished 30-year career in the Senate but in recent years has come under scrutiny for her mental acuity and, in the past couple of months, her ability to fulfill her senatorial duties.  The New York Times reported recently that on top of shingles, Feinstein suffered from complications that include encephalitis, a swelling of the brain that can cause memory problems, increased confusion and trouble walking, among other things.  Feinstein returned to the Capitol earlier this month looking frailer than ever and has needed a wheelchair to get around the Senate. At one point, she seemed to forget that she had been away from Washington while speaking to reporters shortly after her return.  Her office said in a statement upon her return that her doctors have recommended she keep a light schedule as she continues to recover.  The California Democrat has steadfastly refused to step down, with other prominent Democrats siding with her, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

        "text": "© Provided by The Telegraph Cow  The collateral damage of net zero is now getting uncomfortably close to home. First Dutch farmers were threatened with compulsory purchases to satisfy EU emissions targets, fomenting a new revolt in the process. Now it’s Ireland’s turn, where the government is reportedly looking at plans to cull around 200,000 dairy cows to meet its climate targets. The scheme would be a bit like voluntary redundancy, with farmers offered financial inducements to give up their cows.  British beef and dairy farmers are now very jittery. It seems increasingly clear that there is an eco-modernist agenda to do away with conventional meat altogether. It’s not just the Extinction Rebellion mob, either; many of the world’s politicians are on board.  It’s very fortunate we’re out of the EU or we could be facing the same pressure from Brussels. Now, we can only hope that Rishi Sunak, who represents a heavily rural constituency in the Yorkshire Dales, understands what’s at stake for farming communities.  Spending vast sums of taxpayer’s money on destroying productive animals would be a perfect summation of the net zero madness infecting the West. The Irish Department of Agriculture has said that the report was just a “modelling document”, but no sane government would even get to the point of including such a plan in “a deliberative process”. Why? Because it is irrational.  Dutch and Irish politicians have failed to recognise that regenerative farming techniques allow livestock farmers to help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon in the soil. The technology needed to measure soil carbon accurately has been developed by a British company, Ecometric. The results are startling. British livestock farmers could be paid for the net carbon sequestered into the soils after the methane from their burping cows has been accounted for. It would mean changing the way we farm to embrace holistic methods; mainly replacing cereal-based cattle diets with grass, but it can be done.  And we should be embracing the energy-creating capacity of cows. Tallow from British cattle is already being turned into biodiesel – a one tonne animal produces enough for around 180 litres. And thanks to Somerset-based start-up, Biofactory, new anaerobic technology is already available to turn the methane in their manure into usable electricity and heat. The manure itself is converted by this process into a more nutritious digestate that can substantially reduce the need for harmful artificial fertiliser. My own dairy farm is investing in these new green technologies and we hope to be carbon neutral and net exporters of energy in just a few years.  Wreaking havoc on livestock farming families in the name of climate science is also very short-sighted. By the time, if ever, lab food technology, which uses huge amounts of energy currently, is efficient enough to replace the edible fats and proteins from animals, we will probably be using hydrogen technology instead of fossil fuels, and no one will be remotely worried about carbon.  If there are any in Britain minded to follow the Dutch and Irish examples, they should think again. Farming needs to become greener, but through harnessing new technology rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water.

Science Photo Library - MARK GARLICK/Getty Images  Stephen Hawking famously predicted in 1974 that black holes die by evaporation.  But experts thought the extreme gravitational environments of black holes were unique to his theory.  A new study suggests this Hawking radiation that kills black holes could also kill everything else.  The ultimate fate of our universe is unknown. But that doesn't stop astronomers from trying to figure it out.  The most recent idea of how our universe might end is that it will simply evaporate. That's right, everything will evaporate, a new study published in the journal Physical Review Letters suggests.  The scientists from Radboud University were examining Stephen Hawking's theory of how black holes die by a phenomenon now famously known as Hawking radiation, which the theoretical physicist predicted in 1974.  According to quantum physics theory and Einstein's theory of gravity, particles spontaneously form and annihilate under the intense gravitational environment located at the mouths of black holes, aka the event horizon.  Hawking calculated that sometimes these particles are trapped behind the event horizon, but others escape to the outside in the form of Hawking radiation. Over time, enough particles escape that the entire black hole evaporates.  Hawking radiation has been observed around a black hole in our universe, confirming the late genius's predictions. And up to this point, black holes were the only places experts had looked for it.  But this new study may change that.  \"Objects without an event horizon, such as the remnants of dead stars and other large objects in the universe, also have this sort of radiation,\" study author Heino Falcke said in a statement on Friday. \"And, after a very long period, that would lead to everything in the universe eventually evaporating, just like black holes.\"  In the study, the scientists propose that you don't necessarily need extreme gravitational environments for Hawking radiation to exist.  Rather, anything with mass that warps the fabric of spacetime could trigger this radiation.  \"We show that far beyond a black hole the curvature of spacetime plays a big role in creating radiation,\" study co-author Walter van Suijlekom said in the statement.  The scientists' calculations will need further analysis and testing as well as observational proof to confirm their predictions.  If their theory holds true, though, there's nothing to worry about in the near future.  It takes black holes longer than the age of the universe to evaporate, researchers have estimated. While it's unclear how long it would take something like a star to do the same, chances are our universe will remain intact for the foreseeable future.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThis article discusses a new study that suggests Stephen Hawking's theory of black holes dying by evaporation could also apply to other objects in the universe.\nAccording to the study, anything with mass that warps the fabric of spacetime could trigger Hawking radiation, which would eventually lead to the evaporation of everything in the universe.\nHowever, the scientists' predictions need further analysis and testing before they can be confirmed, and it would take longer than the age of the universe for anything to evaporate, so there is no need to worry in the near future.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nStephen Hawking theorized that black holes die by evaporation.\nA new study suggests that Hawking radiation, which kills black holes, could also kill everything else.\nHawking radiation is triggered by anything with mass that warps the fabric of spacetime.\nIt would take longer than the age of the universe for something like a star to evaporate."

        "text": "© Provided by MSNBC Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton reads a statement at his office in Austin on May 26, 2023.  It’s been a heck of a week for Texans fed up with the antics of our criminally indicted, philandering Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. In an unprecedented bipartisan move, a nearly equal match of Republicans and Democrats in the Texas House overwhelmingly voted to impeach Paxton over Memorial Day weekend, putting our state in the unusual position of making national news for doing something eminently reasonable (though way, way overdue). Paxton, whose impeachment documents include 20 articles concerning everything from bribery to conspiracy to obstructing justice, now awaits trial in the Texas Senate, where his wife will be among the lawmakers voting on the future of his career.  I hesitate to call a situation as messy and embarrassing as this one hopeful, but when it comes to Texas politics, the bar has historically been set lower than the deepest offshore drilling operation. We have to take our wins where we can get them. Whether state Republicans consider Paxton a genuine threat to the remaining shreds of their party’s integrity or simply want to end a public relations nightmare, for once they’re actually doing the right thing for all Texans. And the implications for the nation writ large are massive.  The potential for Paxton’s impeachment, and the resultant GOP infighting, to shake up the party’s stronghold on Texas is real. Following Paxton’s impeachment, a 2021 interview he gave to former Trump adviser Steve Bannon began making the rounds anew on social media. In it, Paxton brags that, but for his successful suppression of votes in reliably Democratic Harris County in 2020, Texas would have turned for Biden, and “Donald Trump would’ve lost the election.”  Texans already know — practically better than anyone else — the lengths to which Republicans will go and have gone to block left-leaning voters from casting ballots. But Paxton’s comments, and his possible departure, make the stakes as clear as could be. Texas’ size, economic influence and diversifying demographics make the Paxton impeachment one of the highest-impact examples of a national disenfranchisement story that’s played out for decades, from convoluted gerrymanders to tighter and tighter voting restrictions.  This representation gap makes the firehose of tiresome and smug snarking from some blue staters about getting what you vote for all the more maddening. We no longer live in a political landscape where it makes sense to divide ourselves into safe-blue and dangerous-red states; solidarity from coast to coast absolutely must be the play going forward. America is now one nation under a hyper-right, Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority poised to make the wildest dreams of white supremacist Christian nationalists come true. And on many of Republicans’ biggest-ticket items, even folks living in liberal and lefty geographies won’t be immune to the repercussions.  Take the legal fight over the abortion medication mifepristone. Three right-wing Fifth Circuit judges — a real who’s who of anti-abortion jurists — could rule on a case out of Texas at any moment, and they sounded plenty amenable to the anti-abortion plaintiffs’ arguments during a hearing in May. Their ruling on its own won’t immediately change anything about access to the medication, but as reproductive legal scholar Mary Ziegler told The 19th, “The 5th Circuit is throwing its lot in with the plaintiffs and trying to help them convince the Supreme Court.” If the Supreme Court decides to bully the Food and Drug Administration into severely limiting access to or rescinding approval for mife, “blue” staters will feel the effects, too — whether because of increasingly scarce clinical access thanks to even higher demand for care from ever fewer abortion providers, or the inability to obtain the medication abortion care method of their choice.  And there’s the terrifying possibility of the Supreme Court resurrecting the Comstock Act as a means of banning abortion nationwide, making it a violation of federal law to distribute or deliver anything intended to end a pregnancy, even in states where abortion is legal and protected by state law. It would be extraordinary, certainly, and we could expect legal finagling to follow, but even temporarily interrupting access to abortion leaves people who need it high and dry — it’s not exactly the kind of medical care you can delay while Clarence Thomas has a think. (And we already know what he thinks.)  As for legislation, abortion is almost entirely banned in 14 states today, and we know that more attacks are coming. Republicans and anti-abortion Democrats passed 12-week gestational bans in North Carolina and Nebraska days ago. There are already many grassroots, local and state-based groups organizing to fund abortion access in states where it remains legal, to provide information to those seeking abortion care, to assist folks traveling for clinical care and to defend people criminalized for self-managing their abortions or supporting others who do. The expertise of on-the-ground organizers in states where abortion is banned or heavily restricted — especially for people of color, queer and trans folks, and low-income folks — deserves our nationwide support and solidarity, not snark and a look the other way.  What’s happening in Texas shows us just how thin the line is between the potential for progressive change and more of the same old right-wing repression. Things will almost certainly get worse before they get better, which is why leadership from folks who’ve seen a hell of a lot of “worse” is more important than ever. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe article discusses the potential implications of the Texas House's bipartisan vote to impeach Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nIt argues that the impeachment could shake up the Republican party's stronghold on Texas, and that the implications for the nation are massive.\nIt also discusses the potential for the Supreme Court to limit access to abortion, and the need for solidarity from coast to coast to fight against Republican-led disenfranchisement.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nTexas House voted to impeach Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton in an unprecedented bipartisan move. \nPaxton's impeachment documents include 20 articles concerning bribery, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. \nPaxton's potential impeachment could shake up the Republican party's stronghold on Texas. \nRepublicans have gone to extreme lengths to block left-leaning voters from casting ballots."

        "text": "© Provided by San Diego Union Tribune The loser? House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) got very little for his threat to crash the U.S. economy by refusing to increase the debt ceiling. ( The loser? House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) got very little for his threat to crash the U.S. economy by refusing to increase the debt ceiling. ( (J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press)  No one should be surprised that the resolution of our most moronic fiscal policy, the federal debt ceiling, involved our stupidest social policy, work requirements for assistance programs.  But that appears to be the case. In negotiations between the Biden White House and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's Republican caucus, one of the last sticking points was whether, and by how much, to tighten work requirements for food stamps and welfare.  In coming days, as Congress moves toward votes on the deal, political commentators will thoroughly masticate the question of whether Biden or McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) prevailed in this dealmaking and which of them will be hurt or harmed politically by the outcome.  Democrats right now are willing to default on the debt so they can continue making welfare payments for people that are refusing to work.  Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) tells a giant lie about the debt ceiling negotiations  That's not a very interesting parlor game. (Personally, I'd go with the judgment of Timothy Noah of the New Republic, who thinks Biden emerges as the political victor and McCarthy's days as speaker are numbered, thanks to the choler of his far right wing.)  More important is what the deal says about the principles of both camps. The granular details of the agreement were still murky Sunday, and it could still collapse because of objections from congressional Republicans or Democrats.  The deal, as reported, freezes discretionary federal spending — that is, most of the programs for which Americans depend on the federal government — at current levels for the next two years, with increases lower than inflation. That means an effective budget cut, relative to inflation. In return, the debt ceiling is suspended for two years.  But Biden managed to preserve the accomplishments of his presidency thus far from the GOP's knives. He fended off their efforts to torpedo the support for renewable energy in last year's Inflation Reduction Act, their harshest proposed budget cuts, the rollback of student debt relief, and repeal of his budget increase for the Internal Revenue Service.   Biden rejected Republican demands to impose work requirements on Medicaid, but allowed some tightening of the rules for food stamps — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which is what's left of traditional welfare.  Make no mistake: No rich American will be harmed even a bit by this deal. Some may even be advantaged, if the carve-out from the IRS budget comes from the agency's enforcement efforts; that would help the rich, who are the nation's worst tax cheats.  The most vulnerable Americans, however, will bear the brunt of the deal points. Let's take a look.  Start with work requirements. As I've reported ad infinitum over the years, work requirements on safety net programs accomplish nothing in terms of pushing their beneficiaries into the job market.  They are, however, very effective at throwing people off those programs; that's what happened in Arkansas , where 17,000 people lost Medicaid benefits in 2019 after only six months of a limited rollout of work rules. A federal judge then blocked the changes.  The debt ceiling deal will tighten work requirements for SNAP by requiring able-bodied, childless low-income adults younger than 55 to work 20 hours a week or be engaged in job training or job searches. If they don't meet that standard, their SNAP benefits end after three months. Current law applies to those adults only up to the age of 49. The change will expire in 2030.  © (U.S. Census Bureau) Contrary to GOP claims, the vast majority of food stamp recipients are already working. ( Contrary to GOP claims, the vast majority of food stamp recipients are already working. ( (U.S. Census Bureau)  This rule will do virtually nothing to reduce federal spending, which Republicans say has been the whole point of holding the debt ceiling hostage. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in April that the change would reduce federal spending by $11 billion over 10 years, or $1.1 billion a year.  By my calculation, that comes to 17 thousandths of a percent of the federal budget, which this year is $6.4 trillion.  If it's scarcely a rounding error in federal accounts, however, it's critically important to the recipients of food aid. The CBO estimated that about 275,000 people would lose benefits each month because they failed to meet the requirement.  Biden's negotiators did get the Republicans to waive SNAP rules for veterans and the homeless, which will probably lower that figure and limit the reduction of federal spending.  Work requirements for safety net programs have been a Republican hobby horse for decades. It's based on the Republican image of low-income Americans as layabouts and grifters — the \"undeserving poor.\"  Sure enough, Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.), one of McCarthy's debt-ceiling negotiators, couldn't resist slandering this vulnerable population during the talks. \"Democrats right now are willing to default on the debt so they can continue making welfare payments for people that are refusing to work,\" he said during a break.  Of course, it was Republicans who showed willingness to default on the federal debt. Nor is there a smidgen of evidence that any sizable percentage of this target population is \"refusing to work.\"  The vast majority of SNAP recipients already work, but they're in low-paying jobs that are so unstable that they often drift in and out of employment. According to the Census Bureau, 79% of all SNAP families include at least one worker, as do nearly 84% of married couples on SNAP.  In other words, the GOP insistence on work requirements is nothing but the party's typical performative malevolence toward the poor. If they really cared about getting SNAP recipients into the job market, they'd fund job training programs and infrastructure projects. They never do.  In any case, the only cohort of beneficiaries that tends to move into the job market at all are younger recipients — not those in their 50s. All that work requirements accomplish is to erect bureaucratic barriers to enrollment in the safety net. But that's the point, isn't it?  The work rules for TANF are managed somewhat differently — they're directed at the states administering the program, which have been required to ensure that a certain percentage of beneficiaries are working or looking for work. How the debt ceiling deal applies to that program is unclear.  In the next week or so, before June 5 — the putative date at which the Treasury Department says the government runs out of money to pay its bills without a debt ceiling increase and thus flirts with an unprecedented default — Biden and McCarthy will hit the hustings to claim victory.  But there's really only one way to think about the exercise we've just gone through. It was a supreme waste of time.  Republicans showed they were willing to crash the U.S. economy to make some bog-standard complaints about the federal deficit, most of which they created themselves through the 2017 tax cuts they enacted for the wealthy. Their initial negotiating stance was so extreme that they must have known it could never gain Democratic votes in the House or pass the Democratic Senate.  The Democrats held reasonably firm. They agreed to some modest budget constraints for two years, moved the next debt ceiling cabaret off to beyond the next election, and saved millions of Americans from serious economic pain.  As I've written before, if Republicans were really serious about restraining federal spending, they wouldn't have voted for the tax cuts and budget increases that that contribute to the deficit.  Instead, they said the only way to control spending is to refuse to pay the bills they ran up, by refusing to increase the debt ceiling. They lied, and every thinking American knows they lied. So tell me, why did we go through this again?

        "text": "A 98-year-old woman and her 73-year-old daughter were among the three people killed by an 18-year-old high school student who roamed through his neighborhood Monday firing indiscriminately at homes and passersby in their vehicles, according to authorities in the northwestern New Mexico town of Farmington.  In all, Beau Wilson shot nine people Monday morning before four Farmington police officers fatally shot him, police officials said at a Tuesday news conference.  Gwendolyn Schofield, 98, and daughter Melody Ivie, 73, were killed in their vehicle and Shirley Voita, 79, who also was shot in a car, died at a hospital, according to authorities. Police had previously shared an incorrect spelling of Voita’s last name.  Farmington Police Sgt. Rachel Discenza was wounded in the exchange of fire with the assailant and New Mexico State Police officer Andreas Stamatiadas was shot as he came to the scene.  Four other wounded victims were hospitalized, but like the officers, have been released, Farmington Deputy Chief Baric Crum said.  “The amount of violence and brutality that these innocent people faced is something that is unconscionable to me. And I don’t care what age you are. I don’t care what else is going on in your life. To kill three innocent elderly women that were just absolutely in no position to defend themselves is always going to be a tragedy,” Farmington Deputy Chief Kyle Dowdy said Tuesday.  Investigators are still working on a motive for the shooting, Dowdy said. Interviews with Wilson’s family indicated they had concerns about his mental health, but it was unknown whether Wilson had been diagnosed with any mental health issues, he added.  The shooter only had “minor infractions” as a juvenile, so he was not on the radar of authorities, the deputy chief said.  The gunman turned 18 in October 2022 and the next month purchased one of the three weapons used in the shooting, Dowdy said. The deputy chief said police believe the other weapons were legally owned by a family member and they are investigating how the shooter got them.  One of the guns was an assault-style rifle – a weapon of choice among US mass shooters in recent, high-profile massacres, including the 2012 Sandy Hook school attack and a shooting in Uvalde, Texas, nearly a year ago that left 19 children and two teachers dead.  The attack left Farmington “shaken to the core by an unthinkable incldent that robbed families of their loved ones,” Mayor Nate Duckett told reporters. It is the latest American city to experience the wider scourge of US gun violence that’s resulted in 225 mass shootings in the first 20 weeks of the year.  © Provided by CNN Mourners hold candles Monday during a vigil in Farmington, New Mexico. - Susan Montoya Bryan/AP  The shooter walked through the neighborhood in this commercial hub near the Southwest’s Four Corners and “randomly fired at whatever entered his head to shoot at,” before police fatally shot him, Police Chief Steve Hebbe said in a video statement Monday night.  “There were no schools, no churches, no individuals targeted,” he said.  Dowdy said investigators have not seen a link between the assailant and the victims, but the shooter was staying at a residence in the neighborhood.  Investigators are piecing together how the attack that left more than 150 shell casings over a “wide and complex scene” that spans more than a quarter of a mile unfolded, authorities said. The assailant fired at three vehicles and six houses, though none of the victims was in a residence.  Dowdy said investigators were still at the scene and haven’t found all the shell casings it was unclear how many of those the gunman fired.  Discenza, a patrol sergeant with 10 years at the department, was wearing body armor but was hit by a bullet in the pelvic region, police officials said.  Stamatiadas was shot while driving to the scene, officials said, and drove himself to a medical facility, according to the chief. The mayor said both have been released from the hospital.  Five people were treated at the scene for injuries such as cuts from flying glass.  The shooting was first recorded on a doorbell camera at 10:56 a.m. MT and then emergency dispatch received “hundreds” of calls for an active shooter, police said. Officers were dispatched one minute later, including three who on their way to lunch and responded without body armor.  They arrived at 11:02 and four minutes later the officers killed the gunman, according to Dowdy. Farmington officers were the only law enforcement personnel who shot at the gunman, firing 16 rounds total, officials said.  Wilson was a student at Farmington High School, which was set to have its graduation ceremony Tuesday evening.  Authorities expect to hold another news conference Wednesday.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  California’s financial system, which is propped up by Democrats as the model the rest of the country should be following, is completely unsustainable. Even California Gov. Gavin Newsom is now acknowledging that fact.  California’s budget deficit has risen another $10 billion, bringing the shortfall to almost $31.5 billion. Newsom’s updated budget proposal makes cuts almost across the board, with only public schools and healthcare agencies receiving increases. In his previous plan, the state would be making cuts to climate change programs, despite it being such a dire crisis, according to Newsom himself. This new plan would also cut funding for water storage, which will almost certainly lead to yet another man-made drought down the line.  LIBERAL POLICIES ARE MAKING THE AMERICAN DREAM UNAFFORDABLE  Why is California facing cutbacks in the face of crises both real (water storage) and imagined (“climate emergency”)? Just ask Newsom: \"We have one of the most volatile tax structures because of the overreliance, or the disproportionate reliance, on a very small subset of tax filers,\" Newsom said.  That is what makes California fair and “equitable,” but it also means that the state operates at the whims of wealthy residents. When those residents leave, California’s tax pool begins to dry up. In 2021, the state lost nearly $30 billion in taxable revenue.  The kicker, though, is that this supposedly fair system does not make the state more equitable. In fact, California has one of the largest gaps between high- and low-income families in the country. California has the highest poverty rate in the country, a disproportionate amount of the country’s homeless population, and the lowest literacy rate in the country.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  All the while, Newsom spends his time boasting about how high the state’s gross domestic product is. California is a great place if you’re a celebrity or one of Newsom’s lobbyist friends who are allowed to break COVID protocols with him. It is also an incredibly unequal state where residents have to shoulder high taxes and a high cost of living and still see programs get cut because the state can’t live up to its spending promises if a couple of rich people decide to move.  Simply put, California’s system does not work for most Californians. Newsom himself admits that it is not a sustainable, reliable way to run a state. California is a state run by liberal elites for liberal elites and no one else. Its deficiencies are a feature, not a bug, which is why Newsom hasn’t bothered even to pretend there are any problems as he lobbies for the country to adopt California’s unsustainable, unequal model.

        "text": "Three young children — ages 4, 1 and 11 months — died in recent days after being left or becoming trapped in hot cars for hours in Washington state, Texas and Florida, according to authorities. The deaths of the children, two of whom were left in vehicles as their parents went to church and work, increased the number of hot-car deaths among children this year to six, according to NoHeatStroke.org, a website that tracks hot-car deaths. The six deaths so far this year are double the total at this point last year, according to California meteorologist Jan Null, who tracks the incidents on the website. In Puyallup, Wash., police are investigating the hot-car death of a 1-year-old who was left in a car for more than nine hours May 24. Authorities say the child’s foster mother became distracted and accidentally left the child in the car as she went to work in the social service program at MultiCare Good Samaritan Hospital. When she returned to her car and realized what had happened, the woman rushed the toddler to the hospital, where the 1-year-old was pronounced dead. While the outside temperature that day in Puyallup, 10 miles outside of Tacoma, was in the 70s, the car’s internal temperature hit close to 110 degrees, police say. No charges had been filed or arrests made as of Wednesday morning, and the foster mother and family were cooperating with investigators, according to authorities. “This is a tragic incident and our hearts go out to the family and everyone who was affected by this,” Puyallup Police Capt. Don Bourbon said in a statement, according to the Associated Press. “And just want the public to know that during this time of year when it starts getting warmer, just be mindful of temperatures that are growing and safety of our families.” Studies have shown that cars trap the sun’s heat and turn 70-degree days outdoors into 100-degree temperatures in a car. A child’s body temperature can increase three to five times faster than an adult’s, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Two days after the death in Washington state, a 4-year-old boy died in Houston after he was found in an unlocked parked car with a 2-year-old girl Friday. The children had been playing outside the home when they found their way into a “disabled vehicle,” according to the Houston Police Department. “We don’t know how long they were in there, but family members began looking and found them in the car,” Houston Police Cmdr. Jonathon Halliday said at a news conference. The children were rushed to a hospital, where the boy was pronounced dead, police said. The girl is expected to recover, according to authorities. Tameisha Lewis, a neighbor who lives near where the incident happened in the Independence Heights neighborhood, told KRIV, a Fox affiliate in Houston, that she was devastated by a death that could have been prevented. “My feelings are hurt because, come on now. It’s like a nightmare. A parent’s nightmare,” she said. “Us as parents have to do better watching our kids at the end of the day. It’s a mistake, turned into a tragedy. My prayers are with the family.” No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing, police said. On Sunday, an 11-month-old girl in Palm Bay, Fla., died after she was left in a car for three hours while her parents went to church at Mount of Olives Evangelical Baptist Church, according to authorities. Police responded about 1 p.m. to a report of an unresponsive infant in a vehicle in Palm Bay, about 75 miles outside Orlando. “When they arrived, they learned the infant had been left in a car for approximately three hours while the parents went to church service,” the Palm Bay Police Department said in a statement Tuesday. The baby girl was transported to a hospital and was later pronounced dead, according to police. The temperatures were in the high 70s and low 80s on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. “This is an unfortunate incident, and our condolences and prayers go out to the family,” Palm Bay Police Chief Mario Augello said in a statement, according to WESH, an NBC affiliate in the Orlando area. No arrests had been made and an investigation was continuing, police said. The 11-month-old’s is the third hot-car death in Florida this year, according to data from NoHeatStroke.org. Half of the hot-car deaths among children this have been in Florida. A 2-year-old boy died in Port St. Lucie, Fla., in March, and a 2-year-old girl died in Prosperity, Fla., this month. In 2022, 33 children died of heat stroke in vehicles, according to NHTSA. More than 940 children died of heatstroke in the past 25 years because they had been trapped or were left in hot vehicles, the agency says. “It’s important for everyone to understand that children are more vulnerable to heatstroke and that all hot-car deaths are preventable,” NHTSA said.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThree young children have died in recent days after being left or becoming trapped in hot cars in Washington state, Texas and Florida. \nTemperatures inside a car can reach up to 110 degrees, even when the outside temperature is in the 70s. \nChildren's bodies heat up three to five times faster than adults, making them more vulnerable to heatstroke. \nOver the past 25 years, more than 940 children have died of heatstroke due to being trapped or left in hot vehicles.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the recent deaths of three young children in Washington state, Texas, and Florida due to being left or becoming trapped in hot cars.\nThe number of hot-car deaths among children this year has already doubled from the same time last year.\nStudies have shown that cars trap the sun’s heat and can quickly become dangerously hot for children.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) states that more than 940 children have died of heatstroke in the past 25 years due to being trapped or left in hot vehicles."

        "text": "© Justin Sullivan/Getty Images SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 25: A homeless man sleeps on the sidewalk on November 25, 2019 in San Francisco, California. The Trump administration could be preparing to replace recently dismissed executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness Matthew Doherty and deliver a new agenda to combat homelessness in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  If current trends continue, the place Tony Bennett affectionately called “the city by the bay” will soon be no more. San Francisco, which a massive earthquake could not destroy in 1906 is being brought to its knees by decades of liberal policies that destroyed it from within.  It’s been a long, slow, painful death most people have watched from afar. Mostly because in the last few years it hasn’t been a safe place to go — if one could afford to make the trip.  Over time, the needs of what used to be called “the underprivileged” were allowed to supersede those of the people who pay the bills. City leaders allowed crime to get out of control. The infrastructure was allowed to crumble. The homeless were permitted to defecate on the streets. Addicts got clean needles. San Francisco was allowed to go to the dogs-but the dogs wouldn’t take it.  This was not a natural process. It resulted from policy choices made by elected officials trying to appease voters who believed they’d been victimized, to resurrect a counter-culture term, “by the man.”  They brought wrack and ruin to its residents, who don’t realize they’ve been pawns in a long, drawn-out campaign to replace the nation’s founding values with those embraced by the generation that gave us “free love.” In a sense, San Francisco is the test case for what they’d like to do to America.  They can, or at least they believe they can, because San Francisco has a hold on the Democratic Party that Chicago, New York and Boston can only envy. Many of its most significant funders are there — or nearby anyway, close enough to wield power but far enough that they don’t have to deal with the filth and the muck and mire with which its residents must contend daily.  The most important politicians are San Franciscans too. Vice President Kamala Harris. Nancy Pelosi, who’s still in charge of the Democrats in the House of Representatives no matter who has the title of party leader. Even California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who many people believe is already in the bullpen warming up in case the party elders have to pull Joe Biden from the game before the next national convention, was its mayor.  For all that, you’d think it would be a showplace. Instead, the city is divided into enclaves for the rich and ghettos for the poor, the effects of decades-long permissive liberalism are starting to be felt throughout its environs. It was recently announced that, after 35 years, the Nordstrom chain would be closing its San Francisco stores because of “the deteriorating situation” in the downtown areas.  That means because of the crime and general unpleasantness one now routinely encounters. To put it another way, the general environment keeps shoppers out but is a boon to shoplifters who, it seems, take what they want with abandon because they now have little to fear in the way of consequences.  The local ABC affiliate reported that the Market Street Nordstrom Rack would close on July 1 and the Nordstrom inside Westfield Mall would close in August. This after how many drugstores and groceries and small businesses had already shut their doors for the same reasons. No one, it seems, is counting but the cumulative effect is clear.  The lockdowns, which Gov. Newsom enforced so enthusiastically while dining out at pricy restaurants like The French Laundry, were probably the tipping point that pushed the city over the edge.  The recovery in California has been slower than in most of the so-called red states in no small part because of the situation in San Francisco. Policies that subsidize sloth and foster lawlessness lead to more of it.  Be warned America, no matter who is in charge — what’s happening in the lace that used to be called “The Paris for the West” is what they have planned for your state, your town and your community.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  A central irony of the FBI’s investigation into Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, launched without “any actual evidence of collusion,” has been helpfully emphasized by the final report from special counsel John Durham.  It is that the lies bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton to tarnish her Republican rival as President Vladimir Putin’s stooge may themselves have been Russian disinformation. The sources who gave ex-spook Christopher Steele his tawdry fabrications about a pee tape may have worked, wittingly or not, for Putin’s intelligence services as well as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee.  THE LEFT'S DISINFORMATION MACHINE  U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials who expressed alarm that Russia interfered in the election, among other things with (much exaggerated) disinformation, thus became egregious peddlers of disinformation. And people who claimed to be staunch defenders of democracy against corrosive disinformation sowed, watered, and nurtured that disinformation all over the news landscape.  Like the U.S. Army major in Vietnam who told the Associated Press, “It became necessary to destroy the town to save it,” these valiant would-be rescuers of democracy were wreaking havoc in what at least some of them genuinely believed was a good cause. Some of us suggested back in 2017 that Putin could hardly have dreamed of the success gifted to him by the resistance in his efforts to undermine public trust in our political system.  Left-wing partisans in Washington are trying to discredit Durham, who was widely admired for his professionalism until his appointment thrust him into the maelstrom of federal politics. This is what you would expect, for politicians, political operatives, pundits, and many others in the federal capital make their living by being apparently credible analysts of federal politics. There is thus no hope that most of them will admit they got it almost all tendentiously wrong.  Rep. Daniel Goldman (D-NY) responded to Durham’s report by trashing it as “300 pages essentially denigrating and attacking the FBI.” An offering from a more sinister quarter was that of disgraced former FBI agent Peter Strzok, the guy who told his mistress that they’d stop Trump from being president. He tweet-quoted the New York Times’s unpersuasive view that “Durham’s investigation was politically motivated, a direct consequence of former President Trump’s weaponization of the Dept of Justice.”  Even though the Durham investigation and report were wholly worthwhile, establishing for history that there was an egregious record of wrongdoing by federal intelligence and security services, it will not oblige anyone to admit they were wrong or abandon the position at which they dug in their heels. Deflections, denials, evasions, and counterattacks will ensure that Washington continues on its lamentable way, irredeemably dishonest and irreconcilably divided.  Deviancy has been defined down so far that few senior politician’s or bureaucrat’s turpitude is ever deemed by a bipartisan body of opinion to have risen to the level of an unforgivable transgression.  This is likely to be proven again as more stinking details ooze out about the business dealings and influence peddling of President Biden’s family. Newly revealed documents expose another money network linking the president’s son, Hunter, and shady Chinese investors, this time through the University of Pennsylvania, where Biden was discovered in January to have left classified papers.  The chief executive of China Merchants Bank, which gave $5.5 million to Penn in 2018 and 2019, happened to be a member of an influential entrepreneurs’ club that linked to the Chinese Communist Party, and also happened to meet with Biden when he was vice president. Another Chinese firm, which gave Penn $1 million in 2019, was also a major shareholder in a mining company that three years earlier bought a mine in Congo with the help of a company founded by Hunter Biden.  There are any number of ways in which the president and his son will be able to slither through these details, again by a combination of deflection, denial, evasion, and counterattack, and they will have plenty of acolytes willing to pipe up that there is “nothing to see here, so let’s move on.”  It will work like the aftermath of the scandal which has been confirmed by the Durham report. In that, the most powerful intelligence and law enforcement agencies are revealed to have disrupted an entire presidential term with a pack of lies for the partisan benefit of one half of the ideological spectrum.  In the Biden-China financial shenanigans, a seven-figure check made out to Joe Biden may never be found — presumably none was ever written — but a wide web of financial connections, forgettably named companies, family members, and the strategic and business interests of America’s foremost enemy were all tangled together in ways that peddle influence, procure rich rewards, and allow disingenuous denials.  Sometimes, circumstantial evidence amounts to an open-and-shut case. It seems to be so with the political corruption of government agencies and of President Biden.

PATRICK SEMANSKY/POOL/AFP via Getty Images  A Florida parent tried to get Amanda Gorman's poetry banned, complaining it could \"indoctrinate students.\"  The school says it moved the book, but any student can still read it.  Book bans are on the rise in Florida after Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law prohibiting what can be taught.  A Florida parent tried to get Amanda Gorman's inaugural poem removed at her kids' school, claiming \"The Hill We Climb\" could \"indoctrinate students.\"  And the mother mixed up Gorman and Oprah Winfrey when filing her complaint to the school.  A copy of the parent's complaint, which was obtained by the Florida Freedom to Read Project and later shared by Gorman, shows she requested on March 29 to have the book of poetry removed \"from the total environment\" at a Miami K-8 school because \"it is not educational and have indirectly hate messages\" and it could \"cause confusion and indoctrinate students.\"  The parent — Daily Salinas, who has two kids at Bob Graham Education Center, the Miami Herald reported — also mistakenly said the work was written by Ophrah Winfrey, according to the form.  \"So they ban my book from young readers, confuse me with @oprah, fail to specify what parts of my poetry they object to, refuse to read any reviews, and offer no alternatives…Unnecessary #bookbans like these are on the rise, and we must fight back,\" Gorman wrote on Twitter in response to the news.  According to the forms and documents obtained by the Florida Freedom to Read Project on Twitter, Salinas also submitted requests to ban four other titles at Bob Graham Education Center in Miami Lakes, but the district only took action on three books in addition to Gorman's poem.  The other four titles are \"Love to Langston\" by Tony Medina, \"Countries in the News Cuba\" by Kieran Walsh, \"Cuban Kids\" by George Ancona, and \"The ABCs of Black History\" by Rio Cortez.  The school opted to keep \"Countries in the News Cuba\" on the shelves of the school's media center but moved the other four titles to the library's section intended for middle schoolers.  Salinas told the Herald she \"is not for eliminating or censoring any books,\" but wants students \"to know the truth.\" She questioned why the school chose to keep four of the books available to middle schoolers, arguing that all five should have been restricted for all students, the Herald reported.  She added that school libraries are meant \"to support the curriculum of the school and I don't see how these books support the curriculum,\" according to the Miami Herald.  Gorman said she is \"gutted,\" but the school told Insider the poem isn't banned  Gorman slammed the situation on Twitter, repeating claims that the school banned the book.  \"I'm gutted,\" Gorman wrote on Twitter Tuesday. \"Because of one parent's complaint, my inaugural poem, 'The Hill We Climb,' has been banned from an elementary school in Miami-Dade County.\"  \"Often all it takes to remove these works from our libraries and schools is a single objection,\" Gorman added. \"And let's be clear: most of the forbidden works are by authors who have struggled for generations to get on bookshelves. The majority of these censored works are by queer and non-white voices.\"  But Miami-Dade County Public Schools insisted that Gorman's poem wasn't actually banned.  \"In order to ensure accurate information, @MDCPS is compelled to clarify that the book titled, 'The Hill We Climb' by @TheAmandaGorman was never banned or removed from one of our schools,\" the district wrote on Twitter Tuesday night. \"The book is available in the media center as part of the middle grades collection.\"  A spokesperson for Bob Graham Education Center told Insider Wednesday that \"the book in question was not pulled. It has not been banned. Elementary students can still access the title and they can check it out of the library.\"  Book bans have become the new normal in Florida  Calls to ban books in schools have risen since Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a sweeping education bill into law, which prohibits discussion of gender identity or sexual orientation in young students' classrooms.  Florida expanded the law this year to ban discussions about gender for all grades until college.  According to PEN America, 175 books have been banned in Florida this year.  The organization, along with Penguin Randomhouse, filed a lawsuit against a Florida school district over the book bans, the Miami Herald reported.  \"I wrote 'The Hill We Climb' to that all young people could see themselves in a historical moment. Ever since, I've received countless letters and videos from children inspired by 'The Hill We Climb,' to write their own poems,\" Gorman wrote on Twitter. \"Robbing children of the chance to find their voices in literature is a violation of their right to free thought and free speech.\"  \"Together, this is a hill we won't just climb, but a hill we will conquer.\"<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nA Florida parent attempted to have Amanda Gorman's inaugural poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" removed from a Miami K-8 school, claiming it could \"indoctrinate students.\"\nThe school moved the book to the library's middle school section, but any student can still read it.\nThis is part of a larger trend of book bans in Florida after Gov.\nRon DeSantis signed a law prohibiting what can be taught.\nGorman has spoken out against the book ban, saying it robs children of the chance to find their voices in literature.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nA Florida parent attempted to get Amanda Gorman's inaugural poem removed from her kids' school, claiming it could \"indoctrinate students.\"\nbooks have been banned in Florida this year due to a sweeping education bill signed by Gov.

        "text": "© Raw Story Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, Korean Central News Agency  Donald Trump's former national security advisor, John Bolton, told CNN that watching the former president over the years, it became evident that he was in over his head when it came to international affairs, particularly with dictators like Kim Jong Un.  He began by discussing the Chinese plans for flying close to a U.S. jet and a ship sailing close to a U.S. Navy destroyer. According to Bolton, it's China trying to intimidate the United States and the Taiwanese government.  \"These incidents, as you reported, indicated both on the sea and in the air, are part of a larger Chinese project,\" said Bolton. \"I think they're trying to warn the United States about keeping its commitments to Taiwan supplying it with weapons and the like. We saw a similar speech by the Chinese defense minister at the Shangri-La conference.\"  He called for a \"strategic response\" that would show the U.S.'s might. The U.S. military currently invests ten times more resources than China.  CNN's Jim Acosta asked about North Korea, saying he assumed Bolton saw Trump's recent praise of dictator Kim Jong Un after the country was accepted onto the board of the World Health Organization.  \"Well, your guess is as good as mine,\" Bolton said about why Trump might be giving a nod to Kim. \"I have tweeted about this and said this is one more piece of evidence why Donald Trump is not fit to be president. This is no joking matter. Kim Jong Un is a cruel dictator. His people are among the most impoverished in the world and building missiles to hit the United States and intimidate his regional neighbors. This is not something you pal around with. It just shows Trump has no real understanding of the depth of the threat that Kim Jong Un poses, and it is why four more years of Trump in control of foreign policy would be extraordinarily dangerous for the United States.\"  Acosta remembered the summer in Singapore, where Trump was never able to secure a nuclear treaty, despite being the first president to set foot in North Korea. He asked Bolton about the strange friendship between the two men.  \"Well, we saw warning signs in Trump's reaction to these letters that Kim sent him before the Singapore summit and then after,\" recalled Bolton. \"And now there is no doubt in my mind, these letters were written by some community party hack in the prop of the North Korea Workers Party, but they were filled with phrases like 'your excellency,' and he thought there were love letters. I shook my head. I don't think he understands what he's up against when he faces the hard men of contemporary international affairs.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  The Democratic and Republican parties are moving inexorably toward a mutual political suicide pact — at this point, it’s not a question of which side’s self-inflicted wound will prove fatal but whether both will.  The problem is the likely renomination of Joe Biden and Donald Trump as the 2024 presidential candidates. Most Americans do not want either man in the White House for a second term. Yet the parties’ nominating processes, if not changed, strongly favor another Biden-Trump contest.  The Democrats’ dilemma is the result of past success, while the GOP problem is caused by past failures.  As the incumbent president and leader of his party, Biden cannot realistically be denied the nomination short of some serious health crisis — unless responsible, and brave, Democratic leaders privately counsel him to forgo yet another presidential campaign. Only five presidents have been rejected as their party’s successor nominee, with four becoming president only because of the death of their predecessors. Franklin Pierce was the only elected president denied a second nomination, because of his embroilment in the slavery issue in 1856.  Biden’s age and growing incapacities, and doubts about Kamala Harris’s ability to take over the presidency, have generated concerns among Democrats that it may be a mistake to rest the party’s fate — and the country’s — again on a Biden-Harris ticket. There is a pervasive sense that they were fortunate to have had Trump as their 2020 opponent — possibly the only Republican Biden could have beaten.  But, lo and behold, the GOP is again poised to serve up Trump as the nominee. That is because 60 percent of Republican convention delegates are chosen in states that use winner-take-all systems. Those states award all their delegates to the candidate earning a mere plurality of the popular vote in the primary. That means a zealous, committed minority — e.g., Trump voters — can accumulate a majority of convention delegates by winning as little as a third of the primary vote in several early states. A large field of perhaps better qualified candidates inevitably splinters the majority of the primary voters who want someone else to lead the party. It was the story of Trump’s nomination in 2016.  The flawed and undemocratic GOP nominating system was why former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan decided not to run for president in 2024: He did not want to divide further the non-Trump and anti-Trump vote. Other qualified Republicans, such as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, may have opted out for the same reason — to the party’s and the country’s detriment.  For 2024, the situation is even more skewed in favor of Trump because of changes his allies engineered since the 2020 election. Several states have transformed their delegate selection process from proportional allocation — the way Democrats generally do it — to the winner-take-all approach. Other states have imposed a 20 percent minimum share of the primary vote for candidates to qualify for award of any delegates.  Further, despite Trump’s many legal problems, what some view as prosecutorial overreach in New York has created a backlash that strengthened Trump’s hold on a dedicated minority of the party.  Republicans need to reverse this undemocratic and counterproductive trend and change their rules before Oct. 1 to attract their strongest candidates to compete and have a fair chance at winning the nomination. States that prefer winner-take-all to proportional allocation of delegates should at least consider requiring a victorious candidate to earn 50 percent of the primary vote, with a runoff where necessary within no less than 10 days or more than 30.  With majorities in both parties unhappy with their prospective nominees, and with a vast number of independent voters dissatisfied with the choice offered by the two parties, 2024 may prove to be the first time since the emergence of the modern Democratic and Republican parties that a third-party candidate has a reasonable chance of winning the presidency.  Enter No Labels.  This independent, bipartisan organization, associated with the Problem Solvers Caucus, a centrist congressional group focused on bringing the political parties together to find solutions instead of partisan strife, offers the following mission statement: “This moment demands American leaders and citizens alike declare their freedom from the anger and divisiveness that are ruining our politics and most importantly, our country.”  The message is one that stands to resonate with a huge number of voters, and if the candidate the group says it will present next April reflects that unifying approach, and also possesses the competence and experience to do the job as president, he or she could strike a responsive chord with the American electorate.  As someone who signed the Never Trump letter in 2016 but could not abide the Clintons’ return to power, I voted for a third-party candidate as a voter in the District of Columbia. After Trump’s election, I was impressed enough with the performance of his national security team, especially its transformative policies on China — and worried enough about Biden’s foreign policy record of mistakes — that I was comfortable in voting for Trump in 2020. But his actions since the 2020 election have disqualified him from ever serving in public office again.  In different ways, he and Biden both present dangers to the nation’s security. America’s enemies are salivating at another Biden-Trump contest. Most Americans want to avoid it; as of now, voters are justified in believing the worst Democrats and Republicans are saying about each other. A fresh start with their leaders will entitle them to start believing the best of what they say about themselves.  The Democratic and Republican parties should put the national interest first — or third-party groups like No Labels will do it for them.  Joseph Bosco served as China country director for the secretary of Defense from 2005 to 2006 and as Asia-Pacific director of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief from 2009 to 2010.

        "text": "© Provided by The Guardian Photograph: Sérgio Lima/AFP/Getty Images  Indigenous leaders and environmentalists in Brazil have voiced horror and indignation after lawmakers approved controversial legislation which opponents fear will strike a devastating blow to Indigenous communities and isolated tribes.  Members of Brazil’s conservative-dominated lower house overwhelmingly endorsed bill number 490 on Tuesday night, by 283 votes to 155.  Related: Outcry as Brazil congress moves to gut environment and Indigenous ministries  “You will have Indigenous blood on your hands,” the Indigenous congresswoman Célia Xakriabá told its rightwing backers as leftwingers took to the podium to protest by smothering their hands in the red dye of annatto seeds.  Critics say the legislation, which now moves to the senate, poses a series of profound threats to Indigenous communities and the environment:  • It potentially opens the door to road-building, mining, dam construction, agricultural projects and the use of genetically modified crops on protected Indigenous lands, as well as authorizing contact with isolated Indigenous groups in certain circumstances.  • It would allow the government to reclaim land from Indigenous communities whose “cultural traits” are deemed to have changed.  • Perhaps most damagingly, the legislation would also invalidate Indigenous claims to lands such groups could not prove they physically occupied on the day Brazil’s constitution was enacted in October 1988. Activists say that “time limit trick” could scupper scores of legitimate claims for the delimitation of Indigenous lands, from groups who had already been evicted from their ancestral lands or whose presence had yet to be recognized at the cut-off date.  The Climate Observatory watchdog said Brazil’s parliament had witnessed “its most shameful day since the 2016 impeachment of Dilma Rousseff” – a “show of lies, hatred and racism” which signaled the environmental chaos caused by former president Jair Bolsonaro was far from over.  Lawmakers had sent “a clear message to the country and the world: Bolsonaro is gone but the extermination [of Indigenous communities and the environment] continues,” the Climate Observatory added.  Sarah Shenker, a campaigner at human rights group Survival International, said: “This catastrophic bill is the most serious attack on Indigenous rights in decades … Hundreds of Indigenous territories home to over a million Indigenous people could be destroyed.”  She added: “There are many examples of uncontacted tribes whose existence and location was not yet officially confirmed by government in October 1988 … so if [this] was approved it could be used by anti-Indigenous politicians who are desperate to steal [such territories].”  When Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva returned to Brazil’s presidency in January there was optimism South America’s largest country was entering a new era of sustainable development, environmental protection and respect for Indigenous rights. Lula named the veteran environmentalist Marina Silva as his environment minister and created a ministry for Indigenous peoples run by the Indigenous activist Sônia Guajajara. “We are going to reverse all of the injustices committed against Indigenous peoples,” Lula vowed in his inaugural address, claiming Brazil had a “historic debt” to such groups.  But the rowdy congressional debate that preceded the approval of Bill 490 brought such hopes crashing back down to earth and revealed a starkly divided country.  A succession of white, mostly male lawmakers took the microphone to claim they were supporting the legislation because they considered themselves Indigenous defenders who wanted to help such groups integrate into mainstream society. Many were staunch supporters of Bolsonaro and members of the powerful ruralista bloc linked to agribusiness which boasts 302 of the 513 seats in the lower house and 42 of 81 senators.  Related: Outcry as Brazil congress moves to gut environment and Indigenous ministries  Bibo Nunes, a congressman from Bolsonaro’s rightwing Liberal party (PL), voiced outrage that nearly 14% of Brazil’s territory was in the hands of Indigenous people who represented only 0.4% of the population. “What’s the logic? Explain it to me, you lefties!” Nunes bellowed.  Leftist politicians countered that the legislation would endanger Indigenous lives as well as the global struggle against climate change given the crucial role Indigenous communities have in protecting the Amazon rainforest.  “This is a bill of death, backwardness and regression … This is a crime against Indigenous people,” said Juliana Cardoso, a congresswoman from Lula’s Worker’s party (PT).  But such arguments were ignored and the bill passed easily.  Guajajara told activists to remain mobilized in the face of what she called “a serious attack on Indigenous people and the environment”. “We will remain steadfast and united, as we always have been,” Lula’s Indigenous minister said in a video message.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nBrazil's conservative-dominated lower house has approved a controversial bill that could have devastating impacts on Indigenous communities and isolated tribes. \nThe bill could open the door to road-building, mining, dam construction, agricultural projects and the use of genetically modified crops on protected Indigenous lands. \nIt would also invalidate Indigenous claims to lands such groups could not prove they physically occupied on the day Brazil’s constitution was enacted in October 1988. \nActivists have called the bill \"a crime against Indigenous people\" and a \"show of lies, hatred and racism\".<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the controversial legislation recently passed by Brazil's conservative-dominated lower house, which opponents fear will have devastating effects on Indigenous communities and isolated tribes.\nThe legislation could potentially open the door to road-building, mining, dam construction, agricultural projects and the use of genetically modified crops on protected Indigenous lands, as well as authorizing contact with isolated Indigenous groups in certain circumstances.\nIt would also invalidate Indigenous claims to lands such groups could not prove they physically occupied on the day Brazil’s constitution was enacted in October 1988.\nActivists have voiced outrage at the bill, which they say signals the environmental chaos caused by former president Jair Bolsonaro is far from over."

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Barack Obama  Barack Obama: A Terrible President - We’re living in an age of stagnation and decline. It began around 2006 when the United States had to orchestrate a massive retreat from Iraq, a nation in which the United States chose to go to war with. By 2008, the nation’s economy nearly collapsed, and voters were looking for someone else to lead them.  Americans wanted to elect an outsider. They wanted someone new and fresh. They chose the dynamic, youthful Barack Obama.  Within two years of Obama’s election, though, people were having regrets.  You see, Barack Obama campaigned on promises of restoring hope and bringing change to Washington.  Yet, few people seemed to understand that Obama was himself a creature of the establishment. He had spent his career working up the ladder of Democratic Party politics, first in hyper-partisan Chicago and later, in the nation’s capital as a senator.  Sure, he was opposed to the Iraq War and wanted to nationalize our healthcare system.  But those were easy positions to take for a Democrat back then.  Obama wanted to be post-partisan. It’s a simple assertion to claim that Obama was faced with a highly partisan opposition party. Although, in Obama’s first two years in office, the Republicans had so little power that the Democrats were able to ram through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as “Obamacare”, without a single Republican vote in the Senate.  It was after that action that many Americans came out and voted to give Republicans more power in the 2010 Midterms. The reason was not because the Republicans were blocking Obama. It was because, in the eyes of most Americans, Barack Obama had broken his promise to be bipartisan.  He squandered an historic majority.  Barack Obama Created Many of the Problems Today  During Obama’s presidency, the race-and-class warfare rhetoric that has ripped our country apart over the last decade began in earnest—at the urging of Obama. Even as he was bailing Wall Street out, Obama was playing both sides of the fence, and encouraging Left-wing activists and “community organizers” to rip this country apart.  The Occupy Wall Street movement started during the Barack Obama years, not in reaction to Republican policies, but in response to Obama’s bailouts of Wall Street and his refusal to forgive student debt.  The division and rancor that defines our political culture today was exacerbated by former President Obama. It was Obama and his supporters who turned any legitimate opposition to his presidency into accusations of racism. It was Obama who routinely lied and engaged in bad faith arguments in public to manipulate the American people.  Remember “if you want your doctor, you can keep him”?  Or that time in 2016 when Obama insisted that there was no way that Donald Trump could get economic growth higher than what Obama had gotten it—only to be proven wrong within a few months of Trump’s presidency?  Obama Leads from Behind  Then there was the retinue of foreign policy failures.  Having campaigned as the anti-George W. Bush, the only Democrat who opposed the Iraq War from its outset, Obama vowed to not “do stupid ----” as president in foreign policy. He then proceeded to do just the opposite.  From Afghanistan to Iran to Libya, the Obama foreign policy team destabilized an already unstable region and added to America’s woes there.  Egypt was a hairsbreadth away from becoming the Iran of the Sunni Arab world before the Egyptian military overthrew the Obama-backed Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsi. Washington pushed Israel away under Obama, creating the frostiest relations imaginable with the only liberal democracy in the region all while Obama tried to empower nuclear-arming Iran.  Meanwhile, Obama pulled the United States out of its anti-ballistic missile shield development with Poland, made a generous New START Treaty with Russia which effectively gave Russia nuclear weapons supremacy over the US, and presided over the loss of Crimea to Russia.  Obama then got America rolled big time by Russia in Syria.  After it was believed embattled Syrian strongman, Bashar al-Assad attacked his own people with chemical weapons, Obama wanted to conduct a massive air war against Assad to force the regime to disarm its chemical WMDs. Ultimately, Obama didn’t bomb Syria and instead called on Syria’s allies in Russia to disarm them diplomatically. It turned out that Russia never actually did what it said it’d do.  Surprise, surprise.  Then there was the whole precipitous pullout from Iraq followed on by the birth of ISIS—all of which could have been avoided had Obama managed his drawdown in Iraq more responsibly. And let us not forget the endless drone warfare program that Obama ran.  This was how Obama managed to square the circle that was his campaign pledge to end the Bush era torture program.  Obama Stops Torture but Embraces Mass Assassination  First, he signed an executive order closing the Guantanamo Bay (GITMO) prison where many suspected terrorists were being held indefinitely.  Of course, the order was apparently non-binding, since the facility remains in use today.  Second, knowing that terrorism could still harm the country—and his chances of reelection—Obama chose to simply assassinate any suspected terrorists rather than capture them and acquire critical intelligence from them.  Nevertheless, the drone program has been far more damaging to America’s standing in the region than the torture program ever was. What’s more, it left a huge hole in intelligence collection because we basically killed the bad guys before finding out what they knew about potential plots against the homeland.  The End of an Error  Further, Obama had spent more US tax dollars than the previous 43 presidents combined. He blew a major hole in our national debt. Whatever excesses his two successors have engaged in, Obama completely abandoned any semblance of fiscal responsibility which, in turn, helped to set the stage for the current economic crisis we are entering.  Obama’s presidency was a massive letdown.  He helped to create many of the crises that we are having to deal with today. Plus, Obama paved the way for the current Biden Administration which, if you can believe it, is an even greater disaster than the Obama presidency ever was.  When historians look back at this time in America’s history (if there’s anyone left in the future to study this time), they will identify Barack Obama’s presidency as the point in which the United States began its precipitous from the sole remaining superpower to a dying power.

Officials from the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp that Hitler's Nazis built in 1940 in occupied Poland have slammed an ice-cream stand for setting up shop outside the iconic \"Death Gate.\" Bartosz Bartyzel, a spokesperson for the Auschwitz Museum, told the Polish newspaper Gazeta Krakowska in a statement that it was \"an example of not only aesthetic tastelessness but also a lack of respect for a special historical place located nearby,\" Sky News reported. Despite the outrage at the ice-cream stand's location — a few hundred feet from the entrance to the Nazi death camp — it's parked on public land just outside of the camp, so there is nothing the organization can do about it. \"We trust that the competent local-government authorities will solve this embarrassing problem,\" Bartyzel told Gazeta Krakowska. Nearby residents were also \"upset\" and believed the brightly colored ice cream stand looked \"awful,\" Dagmar Kopijaz of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial Site Foundation said, Sky News reported. The \"Death Gate,\" as it is known in Poland, is the main entrance to Auschwitz II-Birkenau. It is an expanded section of the Auschwitz camp complex, where Nazis kept vast numbers of prisoners in terrible conditions in 174 wooden barracks and murdered them in gas chambers before burning their bodies in the multiple on-site crematoria. In total, Hitler's Nazis killed 1.1 million people in the Auschwitz camp complex from 1940 to 1945. 'Respect their memory' © Galerie Bilderwelt/Getty Images Galerie Bilderwelt/Getty Images The tracks that run through the \"Death Gate\" carried freight trains packed full of Jewish people from communities across Nazi-occupied Europe — the camp killed 865,000 on arrival. Another instance of inappropriate behavior at the site comprised of a woman who internet users criticized for taking a model-style photo at Auschwitz. The woman is seen posing and smiling in the sunshine in the photo. One Twitter user said, \"Today I had one of the most harrowing experiences of my life. Regrettably it didn't seem everyone there found it quite so poignant.\" Responding to the tweet, the Auschwitz Museum wrote, \"Pictures can hold immense emotional & documentation value for visitors. Images help us remember. When coming to Auschwitz Museum, visitors should bear in mind that they enter the authentic site of the former camp where over 1 million people were murdered. Respect their memory.\" Correction: May 14, 2023 — An earlier version of this story misstated the number of people murdered at Auschwitz.

        "text": "Happy Wednesday, America. Now, when you think of San Francisco, what did you use to think of? Cable cars? Rice-A-Roni? Alcatraz? Carl Malden's nose? Yeah. You remember him, right?  Now they call it \"Frisco\" because shoplifter stole the other letters. You may have heard â Nordstrom's closing both downtown stores due to the astonishing amount of shoplifting. When asked about Nordstrom folding, the White House said they thought they already blew that up.  Â© Provided by FOX News Greg Gutfeld: The incompetence of San Franciscos leaders is causing its demise  NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS 'MIGRANT CRISIS' UNDER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS 'DESTROYED' CITY  KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: One of the things that has been out there, the shutdown, the pipeline of Nordstrom one.  Well, yeah, we dug that up. We dug it up. But that could happen to anyone â who among us hasn't confused a pipeline with a department store. I'm sure I've had gas in both. Yeah. Yeah. It's okay to laugh.  But, yeah, another major retailer hauls *** because of crime. Or as Nordstrom put it, quote, \"The dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market have changed dramatically, impacting customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully.\"  READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP  True, nothing impacts foot traffic like those feet hopping over needles and piles of poop or getting run over by violent, looting nutjobs. So let me translate what that statement really means for you. Thanks to liberal policies built out of cowardice from spineless politicians that refuse to judge or punish street scum's criminal behavior. Once again, something that was good has been ruined. May you all die in the next big earthquake. I added that last part for dramatic effect. Yeah. That's why I don't work in P.R. â Puerto Rico.  Yeah, but you can't sell stuff if shoplifters already stole it. And crime makes customers stay away. So it makes it kind of tough to run a business. And it's not just Nordstrom. Twenty stores have closed in downtown S.F. since 2020. Whole Foods, Crate and Barrel, Marshal's Office Depot, Saks, Banana Republic, even the Gap. Thankfully, Baby Gap stayed open. Their onesies fit me perfectly. SF is boarding up so many windows, they better pray Home Depot doesn't close or they're really screwed. Then they'll have to borrow Paul Pelosi's hammer. Well, yeah. He's a victim of crime. He's a victim of crime. And it's all due to the incompetence and willful negligence of local leaders.  You can't blame the pandemic because the policies were there first, and there's no vaccine against that, despite all the syringes. The downtown Whole Foods opened roughly a year ago, and since then there were 568 emergency calls to police. That's almost as many crimes as turds on the sidewalk. I know because I sent Jesse's assistant, Johnny, to count them â he didn't mind.  The report on one 911 call states \"man with machete is back.\" The caller was immediately arrested for assuming the attacker's gender, but the keyword there is \"back.\" So this wasn't his first visit with the machete and he wasn't there to cut prices. It is Whole Foods.  Other calls detailed how vagrants threw food, attacked customers, overdosed on drugs, and even tried to crap on the floor. Sounds like fondue night at Kudlow's house. That's why he's always smiling.  So why not call the cops? Well, you can try, but they might not be there to pick up the phone. The S.F. Police Department has lost more than 330 officers since 2017. I guess you don't have to defund the police if they all quit. So why do people think it's okay to just walk out of a store with an armful of merch without paying for it? Because in places like San Francisco, it is okay.  The city stopped enforcing the law years ago. A decade ago, even. An SF ballot referendum downgraded any theft of less than 950 bucks from a felony to a misdemeanor. It's like playing the Price is Right and you win if the loot adds up to under a grand. At least it's forcing people to do math, something the schools no longer do.  And security guards there are now told not to stop shoplifters. So what are they securing exactly? A low paying job where they get to watch stepmom **** on their phones? That sounds pretty good. And the one thing all these cities have in common? They're run by the left, a.k.a. America hating scum. To progressives, prosecuting crime is racist. It persecutes the oppressed. A smash and grab is really justifiable redistribution.  And who cares of the law-abiding are the ones who get hurt? That's for their white privilege, even if they're Asian, black, or Hispanic. But you can't pick an ideology of chaos and then expect order. We tried to point this out to them and they just laughed. And now the Democrats are paying for it in their own cities. And of course, they'll blame the system and not themselves. Meanwhile, Frisco has spent over 400 million bucks on a net to keep people from committing suicide off the Golden Gate Bridge. If only there were a net for the city itself.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe article discusses the decline of San Francisco due to the incompetence of its leaders and their refusal to punish criminal behavior.\nThis has caused major retailers such as Nordstrom and Whole Foods to close their downtown stores due to shoplifting and other criminal activity.\nThe police department has also lost over 330 officers since 2017, and the city has stopped enforcing the law.\nThe article concludes that the Democrats are paying for their own policies in their own cities.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nNordstrom has closed both of its downtown stores in San Francisco due to shoplifting. \nSan Francisco has seen a dramatic increase in crime due to liberal policies and a lack of enforcement. \nThe San Francisco Police Department has lost over 330 officers since 2017. \nTheft of less than $950 has been downgraded from a felony to a misdemeanor in San Francisco."

        "text": "Pride Month 2023 has arrived, and with it are predictable waves of right-wing bellyaching over the audacity of corporations – or teachers, or schools, or pretty much anyone – showing support for LGBTQ+ people.  Target stores were targeted by online bigots for displaying Pride Month merchandise. Then the ire of the “anti-woke” crusaders turned on Kohl’s, again for the crime of selling rainbow T-shirts. Bud Light was already in hot war-on-woke water for briefly partnering with a transgender influencer. Even Chick-fil-A, once boycotted by the left for its support of anti-LGBTQ groups, got sucked into the conservative boycott blender after people found out the company – brace yourselves – has a diversity, equity and inclusion policy that talks about highly controversial concepts like “ensuring equal access” and “valuing differences.”  Rainbows and diversity are grist for the Fox News outrage mill, and if that’s the bubble you inhabit, I’m sure it all makes sense. But for most out in the real world, for the people who don’t have time to chant “Go woke, go broke!” outside their local Target or live in a state of perpetual anger, it’s all a bit much. So allow me to deliver the direct, unvarnished words I suspect many Americans would like the ever-riled-up anti-Pride posse to hear.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  Some words for the Target-boycotting, LGBTQ-fearing crowd on Pride Month  Hey there, person screaming at a store manager about a Pride display.

I mean, for like five dang minutes, can you just chill out and stop acting like a shirt with a rainbow on it or a movie featuring a lesbian couple marks the end of civilization? What in the actual (expletive) is wrong with you? Did a rainbow stuff you in a locker in high school? Are you so utterly lacking in hobbies you feel your only outlet is tweeting nonsense about “indoctrination” and “grooming” and other words you clearly don’t understand?  Does Satan himself shop at Target?  Benny Johnson, a conservative activist who, like yourself, seems to have way too much time on his hands, recently tweeted, “If you’re a Target shopper you’re funding Satanic child sex grooming.”  Did you read that one? I reckon you did. And I reckon you nodded your head, because that makes perfect sense to you.  © Joshua L. Jones, Athens Banner-Herald USA TODAY NETWORK The Pride flag flies above city hall after a Pride flag rising ceremony to celebrate the start of Pride month in downtown Athens, Ga., on Thursday, June 1, 2023. The Pride flag will fly over Athens during Pride Month.  So I’ll pose another question: What the (expletive) is wrong with you? What the (expletive) is wrong with all of you who have forced the synapses in your malleable brains to fire in such a way that “Target selling Pride merch” equals “Target funding Satanic child sex grooming”?  You realize that to any normal human being, that’s all a bunch of laughable nonsense, right? I mean you get, somewhere behind the wall of hatred you’ve put up to protect yourself from common sense, that YOU are the weird one in this scenario, right?  Is Pride Month a threat to heterosexuals? Of course not, you nitwit  How about conservative big-thinker Ben Shapiro tweeting this on the first day of Pride Month: “Any society that isn't normatively based on heterosexual family formation is definitionally doomed to collapse. Pretending that society ought to be apathetic about such matters – or even worse, condemnatory of the presence of traditional norms – is civilizationally suicidal.”  © Getty Images A Pride flag, totally not hurting anyone even a little bit.  Dude, it’s a month to show support for LGBTQ+ people, not a campaign to outlaw heterosexuality. Maybe climb down off your insecurity ladder and join the rest of us here in the Land of We’re Way Too Busy to Waste Time Getting Twirled Up About Every Damn Thing that Happens.  Down in Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has built a national reputation among the terminally aggrieved by making life as difficult as possible for LGBTQ+ people, a math teacher recently spoke to a school board in Hernando County, criticizing loony far-right fears of “indoctrination” and assorted whatnot: “No one is teaching your kids to be gay. Sometimes, they just are gay. I have math to teach. I literally don’t have time to teach your kids to be gay.”  Few Americans are actually buying into the anti-LGBTQ+ grift  That’s why all this “Pride Month is sexualizing my children” garbage is so baffling to those who don’t reside in an online tornado of opportunistic bigotry. We’re just trying to go about our days, love whoever it is we happen to love, raise our kids to respect and appreciate that people are all different and, in the short spaces between afterschool activities and dinner, maybe pop in to Target to grab a couple things.  If we happen to walk past a Pride display, so what? Maybe we love to see it. Maybe we don’t notice. Whatever.  But for you? For you it’s a plague of locusts. You can’t just walk by it, disagree with it and go about your business. You have to lose your damn minds and listen to dipsticks like far-right commentator Candace Owens, who claimed Target has been “an openly perverted company for a long time” and said on her Daily Wire show that if you shop at Target “you’re gay and you’re a pervert.”  © Jon Cherry/Getty Images The administration of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is moving to forbid classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in all grades, expanding the controversial law critics call \"Don't Say Gay\" as the Republican governor continues a focus on cultural issues ahead of his expected presidential run.  Good grief, do you all realize how bonkers you sound? I feel like we’re living through a terrible reboot of the 1930s propaganda film “Reefer Madness” with hysteria over drugs replaced by hysteria over the existence of transgender, gay and lesbian people.  News flash: LGBTQ+ people exist, they have always existed, nobody gets \"turned\" into anything and if you think letting kids know there are LGBTQ+ people in the world is \"sexualizing\" them, you need a nap.  Liberals get riled up about stuff, too, but let's see if you can spot the key difference  And yes, liberals also get mad at corporations and raise hell over things they find offensive. And yes, sometimes they take it too far. But there’s an important distinction: The stuff they’re getting mad about involves people who are being excluded from public life or having their very existence called into question.  The stuff triggering you all involves people being INCLUDED in public life and having their very existence acknowledged.  Can you spot the difference?  Probably not.  Whatever war you're fighting, it's going to be a lonely one  I’ll leave you with this: Whatever glorious battle you think you’re fighting – and for the life of me, I can’t figure out what it is – you’ve already lost. That saying “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice” has stuck around for a reason. It’s true.  You can shout and whoop and stomp your feet and tweet and sneer all you want. But you’re not going to bend this world back toward injustice. You’re just going to embarrass yourself. And annoy the daylights out of the rest of us in the process.  So maybe settle down a bit. Pet a dog, take a walk, start building model ships.

        "text": "© PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images Migrants board vans after waiting along the border wall to surrender to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Border Patrol agents. The last remaining Trump-era immigration policy holding masses of illegal migrants at bay, known as Title 42, was put to rest last week by the Biden administration. But while there was some initial chaos at the border, it's died down somewhat in the intervening days, leading the corporate liberal media which has been ignoring the border crisis for three years to strike a reassuring tone. It's a mistake. This is just the beginning of a new crisis, albeit in a slightly different form. This is the lull before the storm, as a new wave of migrants heads through Mexico, which has discontinued its Trump-era policy of preventing Central Americans from crossing into its territory. There may have been no panic at the border, but that's because the administration has increased the legal routes of immigration available to the millions of migrants making their way to the U.S. The \"relative quiet\" has allowed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to claim that the administration's policies are \"working,\" but by \"working,\" he doesn't mean that it is keeping illegal immigrants from gaming the system; he means that they are doing so far from the public eye. The administration is now processing illegal migrants as fast as possible before letting them loose. Biden has opened 100 regional processing centers and is paroling as many as 30,000 illegals posing as asylum seekers a day. Many who might have hesitated to attempt the perilous journey to the border will now no longer have to. Biden has opened the door. The issue was never whether or not Title 42 would remain in place. The problem is that having come into office pledging a more compassionate approach to illegal immigration and having, by administrative orders and unfair criticism of the Border Patrol, essentially downgraded enforcement of the laws, Biden engendered a massive surge of migration. The big winners at the border have been the drug cartels who effectively control the Mexican side. Thanks to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's \"hugs, not bullets\" approach to the criminals, the cartels control the traffic in illegal immigrants and drugs and are managing the flow to Biden's processing centers. Some corporate media outlets like the New York Times have begun to notice the human cost of illegal immigration, as in a investigative piece about the fate of children who are trafficked over the border and become virtual slaves or are sexually exploited was shocking. But that just skimmed the surface of a humanitarian catastrophe. Lax enforcement of immigration laws has also given a huge boost to the drug cartels' efforts to maintain the traffic in fentanyl that is fueling the American opioid addiction crisis. This man-made disaster cries out for a tougher response than the administration seems able to muster. Were Biden serious about the problem, he would reinstate Trump's draconian enforcement measures aimed at deterring the flow of illegal migrants and pressuring Mexico to do its part to stop it as well. He should also recognize that America's asylum laws are outdated and that the system is now so overwhelmed by false claims that genuine refugees who truly are in fear for their lives are being prevented from escaping to the United States. Yet rather than stopping illegal immigration, Biden is content to let millions keep pouring across the border, as long as it doesn't lead to negative stories about the chaos there or the plight of both the migrants and the border communities who are being swamped by them.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  A bus carrying immigrants from Texas arrived at Vice President Kamala Harris's residence hours before Title 42 was set to expire.  The 30 men, women, and children arrived at the home of the vice president on Thursday morning and were received by the organization SAMU First Response and Mutual Aid. This bus was the second one to arrive at the Naval Observatory in under 24 hours. The first bus carried almost 40 people, according to NBC Washington.  DEFLORIDA BLUEPRINT: HOW DESANTIS HAS PURSUED A TEDDY ROOSEVELT CONSERVATIONIST IMAGE  \"Many on the bus told me they were from Venezuela,\" a reporter for NBC News wrote on social media.  It is not the first time buses carrying migrants have arrived at Harris's residence. One of three buses carrying migrants to Washington, D.C., arrived at Harris's house on Christmas Eve last year. The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network was on hand to transport the immigrants to a local church and provide them with proper resources.  The buses arrived hours ahead of the end of Title 42, a policy enacted under the Trump administration which allowed Border Patrol to expel immigrants without granting them an asylum hearing. Title 42 was enacted in March 2020 as a precaution during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Busing migrants from Texas to major cities, such as Washington, D.C., has become common practice for Texas since at least last year.

It was a cringeworthy moment in our nation's history and, quite frankly, trashy and classless. (This is not a sentence I want to be writing about our country's senators - Republican or Democrat).  For those who may be unaware, last Thursday, Sen. Fetterman, and we should probably start using that senator title very loosely, showed up to a press conference looking like he had just rolled out of bed. In his embarrassing and slovenly attire, he stood next to four other Democrat senators at a podium while discussing the government impasse surrounding the debt bill. All four other senators wore suits and ties, as does every senator when conducting official business in the Capitol. So how did they allow Fetterman to wear shorts and a hoodie?  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DELAYS FUEL CREDIT PROGRAM FOR ELECTRIC CAR MAKERS  It's well known that Democrats have dumbed down and significantly lowered school academic standards nationwide — changes that have significantly harmed the life prospects of inner-city children. But if destroying academic and education standards in our country's public school systems weren't enough for Democrats, they have now apparently targeted congressional dress codes. It's as if they are just wantonly promoting an open degradation of quality and excellence in our nation to appease some hippie element that embraces utopian chaos.  Have they no shame? Aren't they embarrassed?  Fetterman was surrounded by Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Thursday. Did not one have the common sense to look at Fetterman and tell him he is not a teenager sleeping in his mother's basement and that he is a United States senator? Not one Democratic senator felt compelled to pull Fetterman aside and say something such as, \"Hey, big guy, we don't do that here.\"  Once again, have they no shame? Aren't they embarrassed?  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  It was a sight that one would expect on a Saturday Night Live skit or some other parody or satire, not something from a U.S. senator. But Democrats should also endure some blame. Markey, Merkley, Welch, and Sanders are all experienced congressmen. Granted, one doesn't necessarily need to be experienced to know not to show up wearing shorts and a hoodie to Congress. But someone should have been the adult in the room and told Fetterman to change clothes.  What's next, flip-flops and sleeveless shirts for the summer? Our country deserves a better class of politicians, but Democrats clearly aren't the ones to give them to us.

        "text": "© Provided by LGBTQNation \"We can string them up above a bridge so that the public can see the consequences of that kind of wickedness.\"  A hate preacher told his church’s congregation that parents who allow their children to have “a transgender surgery” should be shot in the back of the head and hung from a bridge as an example to the public. However, gender-affirming genital surgeries aren’t conducted on children.  These comments came from Jason Graber — a New Independent Fundamental Baptist (New IFB) preacher at Sure Foundation Baptist Church in Spokane, Washington.  “Any parent that would have their child, would have a transgender surgery done on them, any parent that would do that, they just need to be shot in the back of the head,” Graber said. “They need to be convicted in trial and immediately shot in the back of the head. Okay, and then we can string them up above a bridge so that the public can see the consequences of that kind of wickedness.”  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  “And so there should be no excuse to not put these people to death, no excuse whatsoever,” he added.  He then said that “there are very, very few people out there in the world today that are actually fighting the spiritual fight.” He told his congregation that he doubts other preachers are willing to say that “these child molesters, that these child butchers, that these fa***ts, all the LGBTQ people, people that desire strange flesh, that they should all be put to death in a public execution by the government.”  It’s worth noting that in the TV series The Handmaid’s Tale, the bodies of LGBTQ+ people are hung in public by a dystopian Christian Nationalist government.  These comments aren’t surprising coming from Graber. He has referred to gay people as “AIDS dispensers,” has previously called for the execution of gay people, and said that teachers want to turn kids transgender to teach them to hate God. In April 2022, he called for LGBTQ+-accepting teachers to be shot in the head or beheaded on live TV because, he claimed, they’re “grooming” kids for sexual abuse. The grooming claim has been repeated by mainstream Republican politicians as a reason to ban LGBTQ+ content from public schools.  He has also said that LGBTQ stands for “Let God Burn Them Quickly.”  New IFB isn’t affiliated with any mainstream Baptist denomination, although both Baptist and New IFB teachings exhibit anti-LGBTQ+ bigotry, antisemitism, and misogyny. But while Baptists merely condemn queer people to hell, New IFB goes a step further, calling for the execution of LGBTQ+ people.  In March 2023, Graber’s church tweeted from its account that it is getting death threats after calling for the death of LGBTQ+ people so many times.  “When someone actually follows through with one of the MANY threats to rape and kill me, my family, and blow up and kill everyone in my church, including women and children and many other vile and filthy things threatened.

        "text": "Russia hit Kyiv with an array of missile fire on Monday in a surprise daytime attack, hours after an overnight barrage of the Ukrainian capital and across the country. Explosions were heard in central Kyiv late in the morning on Monday, sparking sirens and sending residents rushing for shelter just as the city recovered from a more typical overnight bombardment. Kyiv’s armed forced said it downed 11 Iskander missiles launched by Russia in the daytime raid. One man was hospitalized after missile fragments landed in the Podilskyi district, Kyiv’s mayor Vitalii Klitschko said. Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv city military administration, said this attack shows “the enemy changed its tactics – after prolonged, nighttime attacks only, it struck a peaceful city during the day, when most residents were at work and outside.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a video of a child running for shelter as an explosion is heard in the background. “Ukrainian children. Every time an air raid alert sounds,” he said. “This is what an ordinary weekday looks like.” His wife, Olena Zelenska, reposted the video, adding: “Morning after sleepless night under fire. Anxiety once again… Children running and screaming for shelter to the sounds of explosions. But it should not be like this.” Hours earlier, cities across Ukraine were hit by a wave of Russian strikes. The Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said 37 cruise missiles, dozens of Shahed drones and a reconnaissance UAV were shot down by Kyiv’s forces – the vast majority of those fired. © Provided by CNN Ukrainian Police officers inspect a fragment a rocket after a Russian attack in Kyiv on Monday. - Evgeniy Maloletka/AP © Provided by CNN Tracks and white smoke were seen in the sky during the daytime attack. - Evgeniy Maloletka/AP The Khmelnytskyi regional military administration said Russia had attacked a military facility in the western Ukrainian city, damaging five aircraft. The Russian Defense Ministry said later that its forces hit Ukrainian airfields, destroying all targets. “As a result of the strike, command posts and radar posts, as well as aviation equipment, storage facilities with weapons and ammunition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were hit,” it said in its daily briefing. On Sunday a huge wave of Russian drones targeted Kyiv, marking the largest such assault on the capital since the conflict began, according to Ukrainian authorities. Klitschko said a 41-year-old man died in the early hours of Sunday following the attacks. The attack came on Kyiv Day, when the city celebrates its founding. But Russia is so far seeing limited returns from its repeated attacks. The Iranian-made Shahed drones are a cheap way to inflict at least some pain on Kyiv, which for much of the last year has been spared the impact of the Russian invasion. Russia has bought many hundreds of such drones, which cost roughly 20 times less than a missile. Moscow is also hoping to land a psychological blow. Since the beginning of the invasion, the air raid siren has been on in Kyiv for a cumulative 887 hours. But all the indications are that despite the dislocation and exhaustion, the attitude of the city’s population is hardened rather than weakened by such attacks. The greater purpose on the Russians’ part in sending waves of Shaheds is likely to wear down Ukraine’s air defenses, and force them to expend scarce munitions on the swarms of drones. Multiple accounts over the past few months, including estimates in leaked US military assessments, have referred to critical shortcomings in Ukraine’s layered air defenses, especially as its Soviet-era S-300 system - the workhorse of Ukrainian air defenses - is degraded and as it becomes increasingly difficult to find ammunition for such systems.

        "text": "© Jack Dempsey (AP) Former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney delivers the commencement address at Colorado College, on May 28, 2023, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney implored new college graduates to not compromise when it comes to the truth, excoriating her House Republican colleagues for not doing enough to combat former President Donald Trump’s lies that the 2020 election was stolen. In a commencement speech at Colorado College, the Wyoming Republican repeated her fierce criticisms of Trump but steered clear of talking about his 2024 reelection campaign or her own political future.  Cheney, who graduated from Colorado College in 1988, recalled being a political science student walking into a campus building where a Bible verse was inscribed above the entrance that read, “Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.”  “After the 2020 election and the attack of January 6th, my fellow Republicans wanted me to lie. They wanted me to say the 2020 election was stolen, the attack of January 6th wasn’t a big deal, and Donald Trump wasn’t dangerous,” Cheney said Sunday in Colorado Springs, connecting her experiences as a student to her work in the U.S. House of Representatives. “I had to choose between lying and losing my position in House leadership.”  In three terms in office, Cheney rose to the No. 3 GOP leadership position in the House, a job she lost after voting to impeach Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol and then not relenting in her criticism of the former president.  Cheney’s speech touched on themes similar to those she has promoted since leaving office in January: addressing her work on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and standing up to the threat she believes Trump poses to democracy. She also encouraged more women to run for office and blasted one of the election-denying attorneys who worked for Trump after the 2020 election for recent remarks about college students voting.  “Cleta Mitchell, an election denier and adviser to former President Trump, told a gathering of Republicans recently that it is crucially important to make sure that college students don’t vote,” Cheney said. “Those who are trying to unravel the foundations of our republic, who are threatening the rule of law and the sanctity of our elections, know they can’t succeed if you vote.”  In an audio recording of Mitchell’s presentation from a recent Republican National Committee retreat, she warns of polling places on college campuses and the ease of voting as potential problems, the Washington Post reported.  Most students and parents in the audience applauded throughout Cheney’s remarks, yet some booed. Some students opposing the choice of Cheney as speaker turned their chairs away from the stage as she spoke.  Cheney’s busy speaking schedule and subject matter have fueled speculation about whether she may enter the 2024 GOP presidential primary since she left office. Candidates ranging from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have calibrated their remarks about Trump, aiming to counter his attacks without alienating the supporters that won him the White House seven years ago.  Though some have offered measured criticisms, no declared or potential challenger has embraced anti-Trump messaging to the same extent as Cheney. She did not reference her plans on Sunday but has previously said she remains undecided about whether she wants to run for president.  Though she would face an uphill battle, Cheney’s fierce anti-Trump stance and her role as vice chairwoman of the House committee elevated her platform high enough to call on a national network of donors and Trump critics to support a White House run.  A super PAC organized to support of her candidacy has remained active, including purchasing attack ads on New Hampshire airwaves against Trump this month.  After leaving office and being replaced by a Trump-backed Republican who defeated her in last year’s primary, Cheney was appointed to a professorship at the University of Virginia and wrote “Oath and Honor,” a memoir scheduled to hit shelves in November.  Two of Cheney’s five children as well as her mother are also graduates of the liberal arts college.  Cheney’s speaking tour appears to be picking up.

        "text": "© Provided by HuffPost A group of young Black actors bows in front of the audience after a play. Recently, all over the country, high school productions with LGBTQ+ characters have been pulled.  Conservativesseemto agree that queer people are public enemy No. 1. So far, they’ve come for drag story hour,trans people in sports and now they’re dealing one of their lowest blows: Trying to ban high school theater productions that contain mildly gay themes.  This past January, a school in Ohio halted its production of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” partly because one of the characters has two fathers, The Washington Post reported. Other high school productions with LGBTQ+ characters have been pulled all over the country — including the production of “Indecent” at a Florida school and “The Addams Family” in Pennsylvania.  Of course, banning school theater productions because of homophobia isn’t a new concept. In the early 2010s, “Rent” caused a moral panic all over the country, and high school productions of the play were canceled left and right. This time, though, the haters are being extra petty and going after plays with any sliver of queerness. This all feels like part of a larger and more concentrated push for queer erasure and an effort to blot out a space for young LGBTQ+ people.  In many places that do not accept LGBTQ+ people, high school theater programs can serve as the only space where they’re welcome and able to express themselves authentically and safely. To rob queer students of that community because of tangential characters who might or might not be gay is not only an unnecessary reach — it’s evil.  Frankly, I don’t think this is a bone conservatives want to pick. They will never get to erase queerness in the entertainment world. There are so many characters in Disney movies that are queer-coded, from Ursula in ”The Little Mermaid” to Scar in ”TheLion King” and Pleakley in ”Lilo and Stitch.” Let’s not even broach the fact that Mulan was in drag for most of that movie.  So have a seat and just let us live. Queer and trans people will find a way to learn about their identities no matter what. Taking them away from a community of peers will do nothing but likely contribute to the already high levels of anxiety and depression among LGBTQ+ youth.  Sometimes I wonder if I did have the type of safety net in high school that some queer people currently get through musical theater, would I have been a happier teen. Instead, I found myself in genuinely unsafe situations by meeting strangers I met on internet chatrooms and apps to try and foster community. I hate the thought that in 2023, conservatives are hell-bent on turning back the clock and driving our lives underground again.  All this is to say: Please go and find the true source of your unhappiness and keep your greasy, queerphobic hands off these joyful school musicals.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the recent trend of conservatives attempting to ban high school theater productions with LGBTQ+ characters.\nIt argues that these productions can serve as a safe space for queer students to express themselves, and that banning them is an unnecessary and evil act of queer erasure.\nThe article also points out that queer-coded characters have been present in entertainment for a long time, and that conservatives should leave these joyful school musicals alone.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nConservatives are trying to ban high school theater productions with LGBTQ+ characters.\nHigh school theater programs can serve as a safe space for LGBTQ+ students to express themselves.\nQueer and trans people will find a way to learn about their identities no matter what.\nConservatives should leave these joyful school musicals alone and find the true source of their unhappiness."

A 12-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy died in hospital after being pulled from the sea around 4.30pm. Eight other people - the majority of whom are believed to be children - who also got into difficulty in the water needed medical treatment. A man aged in his 40s, who was “on the water” at the time, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and remains in custody, police have confirmed. Bob Rosa, a former GP who is now a Chief Medical Officer, happened to be on the popular resort beach when the incident occured on Wednesday afternoon. On LinkedIn, he described how he had helped try to resuscitate the 12-year-old girl who was pulled from the water, and who later died. Speaking to MailOnline, he criticised those who stood by filming the attempts to save lives. “Those videoing the desperate CPR attempts should think long and hard at their actions,” he said. “The tragic death of a child is not something anyone should voyeuristically observe.” He added that he has “never seen anything as bad as this” in his 18-year career, which has included time working in A&E. “It was utterly exceptional and harrowing,” he told MailOnline. “They were carrying out CPR on two children while searching the water for others. “There were police, paramedics, doctors, the RNLI. They did everything they could for those children. It’s a terrible tragedy.” Eyewitness Nicola Holton, who had been on the beach with her partner and their two children when the tragedy happened, described it as “like a scene from a horror film”. Speaking to MailOnline, she recalled “loads of idiots ignoring lifeguard requests to get out of the water and clear the beach”. “People were running towards those having CPR filming on their phones,” she added. On LinkedIn, Dr Rosa praised lifeguards who were manning the beach on Wednesday for their “exceptional” response. “Many of the lifeguards on the beach were teenagers themselves and despite their training would not have encountered such a scene, let alone having to resuscitate two children simultaneously whilst actively searching for others in a crowded sea. “These young lifeguards did everything asked of them, they didn’t panic, there was no hysteria, they were exceptional and they followed instruction to the letter whilst taking their own initiative.” Details of the tragedy remain unclear, but police shed further light on what happened at a press conference on Wednesday. Putting to bed swirling speculation, Dorset Police Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Farrell said: “Early investigation indicates that there was no physical contact between a vessel and any of the swimmers at the time of the incident. “I can also confirm there is no suggestion of people jumping from the pier or jet-skis being involved.” For everything we know about the tragedy so far, click here.

        "text": "© Raw Story Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC held at the Hilton Anatole on July 11, 2021, in Dallas, Texas. - Brandon Bell/Getty Images North America/TNS  The first rule of business and marketing is that if you make it easy for folks to buy your product or engage with you, more people will do so. If you don’t want people to buy or use your product or service, on the other hand, just make them jump through hoops to complete the transaction and many won’t bother.  Republicans know this and have been applying it to voting for the better part of 50 years; recently they’ve turned it into a science.  Polling before the 2020 election in Texas, for example, showed that Joe Biden may beat Trump just as he did in so many other swing states across the country. From Trump failing there, the Republican elders in the state knew, it would be a short jump to flipping the entire state Blue, as happened with Michigan and Wisconsin.  Harris County — basically, solid-Blue Houston — laid out a plan to send out forms to all its 2.5 million registered voters to qualify for mail-in ballots (it was during the pandemic and before vaccines were available, after all).  Making it easier to vote, even during a pandemic, was definitely a bridge too far for the GOP: it sent (now impeached) Attorney General Ken Paxton into action.  Paxton immediately filed a lawsuit to stop the largest Democratic county in all of Texas from making voting convenient.  The state had spent years, after all, driving up the number of hours voters in Democratic parts of the state had to wait in line to cast a ballot and they weren’t about to let voting become painless.  A 2020 study by Northern Illinois University ranked Texas dead last in the nation in ease of voting, with the GOP having put into place a whole series of roadblocks designed to make it hard to register or even to vote during elections.  Paxton explained to Steve Bannon how well his lawsuit worked, bragging about forcing millions of Houstonians to take their lives in their hands if they really wanted to vote:  “If we’d lost Harris County—Trump won by 620,000 votes in Texas. Harris County mail-in ballots that they wanted to send out were 2.5 million,” Paxton told Steve Bannon in June, 2021 adding, “and we were able to stop every one of them.”  Texas’ 38 electoral votes were crucial to Trump even getting close to beating Biden, and if heavily Democratic Harris County/Houston had been able to easily vote in large numbers — it was even less safe to vote during a pandemic in a high-population-density city like Houston than in rural Texas — Republicans would be toast.  So he essentially denied them an opportunity to vote without exposing themselves to a deadly disease that ultimately killed over 1 million Americans.  “If you want to vote in Houston,” Paxton essentially said, “you’re going to have to expose yourself to Covid.”  As Paxton pointed out to Bannon:  “Had we not done that, we would have been in the very same situation — we would’ve been on Election Day, I was watching on election night and I knew, when I saw what was happening in these other states [that did expand mail-in voting for the pandemic], that that would’ve been Texas. We would’ve been in the same boat. We would’ve been one of those battleground states that they were counting votes in Harris County for three days and Donald Trump would’ve lost the election.”  This kind of massive and morally reprehensible voter suppression is pretty much limited to Republican-controlled states. It’s their latest strategy for holding power.  In contrast to Texas (60.4% voter turnout), I live in the easiest state in the union to vote: Oregon (75.5% voter turnout).  For over a quarter-century, voting in Oregon has been conducted entirely by mail. There are polling places in a few government buildings for disabled people, but otherwise everybody gets their ballot in the mail six weeks or so before the election and can send them back in an enclosed, postage-paid envelope right up to and including on election day.  From Minnesota (79.9% turnout) to Maryland (71.1% turnout), Democratic-controlled states that make it easy to vote and don’t throw up obstructions to voting by mail generally have the highest turnout.  Colorado, Oregon, Washington state, Hawaii, and Utah conduct their elections entirely by mail. By contrast, Oklahoma (54.9% turnout), Arkansas (56% turnout), West Virginia (57.5% turnout) and Tennessee (59.8% turnout) all throw up obstacles to registering to vote and voting by mail, and thus have low voter turnout.  In the week or three after our ballot arrives in the mail, Louise and I find the time to sit down at the dining room table with a laptop and look up all the obscure races that used to confound us when we had to vote in person and couldn’t bring anything into the booth with us.  Voting for judges, ballot measures, city and county races, etc. that once involved wild guesses are now thoughtful and specific: democracy in Oregon is strengthened by every voter having this same ability.  And throughout those two-plus decades that Oregonians have voted entirely by mail, there hasn’t been a single credible claim of consequential, election-altering voter fraud. It’s a phrase that only makes the local newspapers when Republicans in some other state are using it to justify blocking people from registering or voting.  Using Donald Trump’s “stolen election” lies as the basis for their actions, legislators in every Republican-controlled state in the nation have made it harder to vote over the past few years. States under Democratic control, on the other hand, have uniformly made it more convenient to vote.  With the exception of voting-obsessed first-in-the-nation New Hampshire, all of the top-10 voter turnout states are controlled by Democrats.  This is no way to run a democracy: the right to vote should not be a partisan issue.  America needs national voting standards, and the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution offers a basis for them. Section 4 of Article IV of the Constitution says:  “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government....”  The Framers of the Constitution were clear about the importance of that clause; it was proposed by Pennsylvania’s James Wilson at the Constitutional Convention on July 18, 1787 and almost the entire day was spent debating it.  It’s an amazing sentence, that could be as sweeping in its power as the Commerce Clause (which JFK and LBJ used to force integration of the South) but has never been used in any meaningful way since it was written on that hot summer day in 1787.  The first time the “Guarantee Clause” came before the Supreme Court, slavery was the law of the land and Chief Justice Roger Taney, a slaveholder himself, was determined to keep it that way by bottling up the Clause’s power under the rubric of states’ rights.  Seven years before he tried to cement slavery into the law of every state in the union with his Dred Scott decision, Taney ruled in Luther v Borden (1849) that the Supreme Court should never be allowed to interfere with “state’s rights” on the basis of the Guarantee Clause.  “Under this article of the Constitution,” Taney wrote, “it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a state.”  In other words, Taney said: The definition of what a ‘Republican Form of Government’ actually means isn’t yet laid out in the law or previous interpretations of the Constitution: therefore, it’s politics. And politics is the province of Congress, not the Supreme Court, which must limit itself to law.  On that foundation, later Supreme Courts repeated Taney’s pro-slavery “states’ rights” assertion that the question was political and not one to be decided by the courts: instead, it was up to the politicians in Congress if they were going to “guarantee a Republican Form of Government” to — or within — any particular state at any point in the future.  Taney was quoted “lucidly and cogently” in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph v Oregon (1912) and Chief Justice John Roberts noted in 2019 that, “This Court has several times concluded that the Guarantee Clause does not provide the basis for a justiciable claim.”  Thus, to this day, it’s up to Congress, not the Court, to decide what a “Republican Form of Government” is and how Congress will guarantee it to and/or within every state.  Which brings us to today, and how Congress can use that clause to end partisan gerrymanders, dial back the power of money in politics, and guarantee the right of every American citizen to vote without undue difficulty.  Back in 2021, Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski joined with Senators Kaine, King, Merkley, Padilla, Tester, and Warnock to propose the Freedom To Vote Act.  The opening of the Act laid it’s goals out clearly:  “Congress also finds that it has both the authority and responsibility, as the legislative body for the United States, to fulfill the promise of article IV, section 4, of the Constitution, which states: ‘The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a “Republican Form of Government.”’” [emphasis added]  The proposed law even notes as justification for its existence how the Supreme Court has dropped — or laid down — the ball and therefore Congress must pick it up:  “Congress finds that its authority and responsibility to enforce the Guarantee Clause is clear given that Federal courts have not enforced this clause because they understood that its enforcement is committed to Congress by the Constitution.”  The Freedom To Vote Act would have ensured a “Republican Form of Government” in America and undone 50 years of obstacles Republicans have placed in front of voters. It included:  — Automatic voter registration and online registration for 16 year olds who will be 18 and thus eligible to vote in the next election  — Same day voter registration nationwide  — An end to partisan gerrymandering  — Limits on campaign contributions to a maximum of $10,000  — Criminalization of “pass through” groups to get around campaign finance laws  — A requirement by all corporations to fully and rapidly disclose all election spending over $10,000  — Making all websites (like Facebook) with more than 50 million users create a publicly available and publicly searchable archive of political ads  — Brings web-based election expenditures under the same disclosure rules as TV  — Makes it a federal crime to prevent a qualified person from registering to vote  — Requires 14 consecutive days for early voting, at least 10 hours each day  — Requires easy access to polling places for rural and college campus voters, and easy access to voting for all voters by public transportation  — Guarantees that all voters, nationwide, can vote by mail with no excuses necessary  — Guarantees that all voters can put themselves on a permanent vote-by-mail list and automatically receive a ballot in the mail  — Requires states to give voters the ability to track their mail-in ballots to be sure they’re counted or contest any challenge to their ballot  — Forbids states from forcing mail-in voters to have their ballots witnessed, notarized, or jump through other onerous hoops  — Requires secured and clearly labeled ballot drop boxes in all jurisdictions  — Requires the Post Office to process all ballots on the day they’re dropped off and without postage  — Requires states to keep voting lines shorter than 30 minutes in all cases and places  — Allows people waiting in line to vote to receive food or water from others  — Gives the right to vote to all felons who have served their sentences, in all states  — Prohibits voter “caging” where failure to return a postcard gets you purged  — Prohibits states from deleting voters from the rolls because they haven’t recently voted  — Empowers voters to sue in federal court any state or local officials who interfere with their right to vote  — Criminalizes intimidating, threatening, or coercing any election official or election worker  — Requires federal prosecution of anybody who tries to harm or undermine public officials by doxxing the personal information of an election worker or their immediate family  — Makes it a federal crime to publish or distribute false information about elections (when, where, etc.)  — Increases federal penalties for voter intimidation or otherwise interfering with our absolute right to vote  — Keeps partisan “poll watchers” at least 8 feet from voters in all circumstances, including while voting  — Requires paper ballots in all cases and all elections (there are exceptions for disabled voters)  — Requires post-election audits  — Provides criminal penalties for any candidate or campaign that fails to fully and immediately report any interactions with foreign governments  — Gives lower income individuals $25 they can use to give to candidates in $5 or more increments.  The legislation died from a Republican filibuster in the Senate in 2022, but if Democrats and Republicans who actually believe in democracy can gain a large enough majority in the upcoming elections this November and next, it should be pushed to the front of the line of new legislation.  Republicans know the only way they can continue to hold onto national power — and even keep their control over states like Texas, Georgia, and Florida — is by making it difficult to register and vote, by criminalizing voter registration drives, and by arresting and parading before TV cameras Black former felons who unwittingly voted.  There are limits to their cynical game, though, and the more clearly Americans realize how a process that should be painless and convenient, including vote-by-mail — as it is here in Oregon and in many other advanced democracies around the world — the sooner we can achieve that “more perfect union” the Founders set as our national aspiration.

        "text": "© Provided by The Telegraph Vladimir Putin  Sanctions against Russia have been the unsung success story of the advanced democracies. Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage military war against Ukraine, and geo-ideological war against the liberal world, is being ground down systematically with each passing month.  Earnings from Russia’s oil and gas exports fell by 52pc over the first four months of this year, and hydrocarbon rent is what funds two-fifths of the Kremlin’s budget.  Last year, Putin had no difficulty financing his invasion from the windfall gains of the energy price spike, caused in large part by his own actions. He could raise pensions by 10pc and scatter enough money to shield Russia’s people from the hardship of the war. This year he will have to choose between guns and butter.  It was never going to be easy to blockade the world’s largest country, central to the international supply of grains, fertilisers, energy, and the gamut of critical commodities. Nor was it ever going to be possible to corral the global South without provoking a backlash and splitting the world into two camps.  Yet so far, the democracies have navigated this war with skill. I hesitate to talk of the “West” in this context because that plays to Xi-Putin propaganda. The Eastern democracies of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan are also participating in the soft blockade.  Europe has survived the loss of Putin’s gas in a better shape than most could have imagined a year ago, least of all Putin. Prices have collapsed to €25 MWh from a peak of €304 last August. They are not far above the median price of the last decade. The January TTF contract is €43.  We no longer have to fear a second and even more painful energy shock this winter. Gas storage tanks are already 75pc full in Germany and 74pc in Italy, at least 20 points higher than the seasonal norm.  China’s stalled recovery has cratered Asian demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG). Tom Marzec-Manser from analysts ICIS said LNG cargoes are instead flooding into Europe at “record volume”  Russia has lost all but a sliver of its European gas market, and lacks the pipelines to switch its West Siberian wells to Asia. Europe’s gas demand is henceforth on a rapid downward slope.  JP Morgan says last year’s shock forced a permanent shift in behaviour that has already cut gas needs by 5pc. The breakneck roll-out of wind and solar will mechanically slice it by another 20pc this decade.  Yes, Russia is still selling near record amounts of oil. This is a feature, not a bug, of the G7’s $60 price cap, introduced last December.  “The mechanism was designed to reduce export prices for Russian crude oil and petroleum products, not to reduce export volumes,” said the Finnish central bank.  The purpose of the cap is to dry up Putin’s revenue stream without causing a global oil shock and a political uprising in Europe. It is working like a charm.  The International Energy Agency says Russian Urals crude traded at average of $52 over the first quarter, half the level of a year ago and a $25-30 discount against Brent.  The democracies control 90pc of the world’s tanker fleet through direct ownership or through financing and the P&I club that covers complex spill liability for shipowners, at $1 billion a shot. Without insurance you cannot take these floating firebombs through the Oresund or the Bosphorus, or enter most of the world’s ports.  Putin can export as much oil as he wants in G7-controlled ships so long as he complies. He vowed defiance, issuing a decree prohibiting the sale of Russian crude to any entity abiding by the G7 cap.  It was an implicit threat to withhold 4pc of the world’s supply of crude. In the end, Putin meekly complied. He does not have the money to sustain a long oil war, and he cannot risk permanent damage to his oil fields (already in trouble).  Putin is of course free to sell seaborne oil at any price to China, India, or any country using ships outside the G7 nexus. Trafigura says he has collected a “shadow fleet” of some 500 ships, drawing on a network of global shell companies using old tankers that operate with their transponders switched off.  Using this dark fleet comes at a stiff cost. Some 80pc of Russia’s tanker exports of crude and its products leave western ports in the Baltic and the Black Sea. The system was designed to supply Europe.  The round-trip from St Petersburg to Hamburg takes six days. The round-trip to Shanghai takes 90 days, with freight rates, crew fees, and bunker fuel costs to match. There is a further snag: Russian ports cannot handle Suezmax supertankers. The oil has to be shipped in smaller Aframax tankers, and is then transferred to the big beasts at semi-clandestine spots, off Ceuta and off the Greek Peloponnese.  This may be an ecological nightmare but it is not a breach of sanctions – unless operations are a front for Greeks shipowners, as Ukraine alleges – but it is not a failure of G7 policy. It costs Putin an extra $12 a barrel to reach markets in Asia.  Indian and Chinese traders then beat down the price, knowing that he is a distressed seller. “I doubt that Russia is netting more than $20 a barrel given their own cost of production,” said Prof Alan Riley from the Atlantic Council.  Putin cannot fund a war machine on this. Russia’s budget deficit for the first four months of this year ballooned to $40bn, blowing through the target for the whole of 2023.  The country can no longer borrow abroad – not even China is stepping in with real money – and lacks a deep bond market at home. The Atlantic Council says the Russian treasury has managed to raise $12.5bn in OFZ bonds this year but at a punitive rate above 10pc.  The Kremlin is now shaking down its own oligarch base, forcing “voluntary” contributions. “Large firms are increasingly subject to the whims of those in power,” says the Finnish central bank.  The treasury has so far covered much of the deficit by running down its current account. This is unsustainable. Putin can raid the rainy-day welfare fund for a while, $155bn if you believe Russian data at this juncture, but much of it is in illiquid holdings, such as a stake of Sberbank. A crunch is coming.  Economic blockades can never win a quick war. But the G7 squeeze is degrading Putin’s war machine sufficiently to give Ukraine a fighting chance.  The US Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) estimates that Russia has lost up to 40pc of its pre-war tank fleet. It continues to lose 150 tanks a month but can produce only 20 a month at its UralVagonZavod plant.  Russia is drawing down on its Soviet reserve, with T64 and even T55 tanks appearing on the battlefield. It lacks the hi-tech components to upgrade these dinosaurs with accurate sights, causing a two kilometre loss of range.  It is the same story to varying degrees with artillery, rocket systems, helicopters, and electronic warfare. The shortage of high-quality bearings and microchips is holding back war repair and production.  Russia needs 30,000 basic chips a month to keep the show on the road: it makes only 8,000. It can buy chips from China but these have to be redesigned fundamentally to fit a technology system that evolved using chips from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices.  The CSIS says Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft are being held together with 17 components from old engines. KamAZ is again building antique 820 (V8) tractor engines because China’s Weichai cut off the supply of advanced engines for fear of sanctions. Russia no longer has access to the precision machine tools needed to sustain a cutting-edge war machine.  The Kremlin can continue to rely on the global black market to smuggle in key components. But it all takes time and money. Russia has neither as Ukraine prepares its counter-offensive. Sanctions are most assuredly working. Besides, there is no other moral choice.

        "text": "© Provided by Salon Donald Trump arraignmentSTEVEN HIRSCH/POOL/AFP via Getty Images  Donald Trump, the traitor ex-president who attempted a coup on Jan. 6, a confirmed sex predator, an indicted felon who has been arrested for his alleged crimes, a white supremacist, an enemy of democracy and the humane society, a man who behaves as though he is a sociopath if not a full-on psychopath, a criminal mastermind, and presumed Republican 2024 presidential nominee made the following pronouncement via his Truth Social disinformation platform in \"honor\" of Memorial Day on Monday:  HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY TO ALL, BUT ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO GAVE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE FOR THE COUNTRY THEY LOVE, AND TO THOSE IN LINE OF A VERY DIFFERENT, BUT EQUALLY DANGEROUS FIRE, STOPPING THE THREATS OF THE TERRORISTS, MISFITS AND LUNATIC THUGS WHO ARE WORKING FEVERISHLY FROM WITHIN TO OVERTURN AND DESTROY OUR ONCE GREAT COUNTRY, WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN IN GREATER PERIL THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW. WE MUST STOP THE COMMUNISTS, MARXISTS AND FASCIST \"PIGS\" AT EVERY TURN AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  While too many among the American news media have convinced themselves – incorrectly – that repeatedly listing Trump's many crimes and other horrible behavior is \"counter-productive\" and \"unnecessary\" because \"everyone knows it already,\" it remains critically important to continue to do so. Why? One of the main ways that fascism and authoritarianism and other anti-democracy movements take hold in a society is through normalization.  In total, the mainstream news media, political class, and the American people have, for various reasons, become largely numb to the aberrant, anti-human and generally pathological behavior of Donald Trump and the larger Republican fascist and MAGA movement. Moreover, in the case of the mainstream news media (see CNN's recent Trump \"town hall\" special), as an institution it has largely decided that Donald Trump and his 2024 presidential campaign and legions of MAGAites are too good for business to be condemned and then subsequently treated as the existential threat to American democracy they actually are.  Related Newly obtained recording features Trump weighing dangers of sharing classified Pentagon information  As such, the denial, normalization, hope-peddling and wish-casting and the other obsolete and dangerous habits and norms (bothsidesism, fairness, neutrality, balance, objectivity, access journalism, etc.) that helped to normalize Donald Trump in 2016 are being committed again.  \"There is a through-line that fuels the inner Trump. Though his words seem to tumble out spontaneously, their essence is consistent: He is a racist and a xenophobe.\"  To make these errors again, after seven years of experience, is a choice.  So how should the American news media be covering Donald Trump and his 2024 campaign?  In a time of democracy crisis, the news media should be (even more) speaking truth to power by holding elected officials and other elites accountable, engaging in bold truth-telling, consistently sounding the alarm about the many threats facing American democracy, and then explaining to the public what they should know about them. The news media should also be explaining to the public how the various policies advocated for and put in place by the country's political leaders are directly impacting their day-to-day lives.  A critically important new article at The Washington Post, \"The deepening radicalization of Donald J. Trump,\" takes on this task by thoroughly documenting how the traitor ex-president has spiraled, becoming even more extreme and dangerous in his threats and behavior as the 2024 Election approaches.  The Washington Post begins:  Now, as Trump seeks to return to the White House, he speaks of Jan. 6 as \"a beautiful day.\" He says there was no reason for police to shoot the rioter attempting to break into the House chamber, and he denies there was any danger to his vice president, Mike Pence, who was hiding from a pro-Trump mob chanting for him to be hanged. He has promised to pardon many rioters if he becomes president again. On this and a host of subjects, from sexual assault to foreign and domestic policy, Trump's positions have become even more extreme, his tone more confrontational, his accounts less tethered to reality, according to a Washington Post review of Trump's speeches and interviews with former aides. Where he was at times ambiguous or equivocal, he's now brazenly defiant.  The Post continues:  The hardening of Trump's stances comes as he has been operating for more than two years without the official apparatus of the White House, putting fewer gatekeepers and layers of review between him and the public. It also follows a long list of grievances he has accumulated from his eight years in politics. To experts who have reviewed his proposals, Trump is sketching out the contours of a second term potentially more dangerous and chaotic than his first. Critics across the political spectrum have voiced alarm at his increasingly menacing rhetoric. But Trump's most loyal supporters have relished his combative speeches and followed him in espousing harsher stances. \"When authoritarian leaders lose office, they come back, like, 10 times worse — they never get less extreme, they always get more extreme,\" Ben-Ghiat said. \"January 6 was a profoundly radicalizing event for the base, for the GOP and for Trump himself, because even assaulting the Capitol you could get away with. His campaign events have to be seen as that of an extremist radicalizing people and emotionally reeducating people to hate people.\"…  For all its strengths, however, this new reporting by The Washington Post continues with the same dangerous choice(s) that has plagued and undermined the mainstream news media's ability to accurately and effectively communicate to the public the extreme dangers to American society and democracy embodied by Donald Trump and the Republican fascists and larger MAGA movement: No mental health experts were quoted or otherwise featured in the text of the article.  \"Trump's behavior is worse now but that's only because we're seeing a peeling away of his façade as he becomes more desperate.\"  Trumpism, like other forms of fascism, is first and foremost an example of collective pathology and other maladaptive behavior on a societal scale. Mental health professionals have the training to explain and diagnose such behavior, as manifest by both individuals and on the collective level.  Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.  As an intervention against this consistent failing by the mainstream news media, I asked two of America's leading mental health professionals, Dr. Lance Dodes and Dr. Justin Frank, for their insights about The Washington Post's new profile of Donald Trump's increasingly dangerous behavior.  Dr. Justin Frank, who is the author of the book \"Trump on the Couch\", said this:  The Washington Post article, \"The deepening radicalization of Donald J. Trump\" is mistitled. I would call it, \"The deepening recognition of the real Donald J. Trump.\" Trump is best described in the article by his former advisor, John Kelly, who said, \"There is no compass. What is right today is not necessarily tomorrow.\" From a psychoanalytic perspective, Trump manages his chronic, massive anxiety by searching for certainty in the moment. Kelly is right: Trump is always situational. But his divisive, dangerous rhetoric is the same old story. There is a through-line that fuels the inner Trump. Though his words seem to tumble out spontaneously, their essence is consistent: He is a racist and a xenophobe. Just one week after his 2017 inauguration, he released an executive order to protect America from \"foreign terrorist entry into the United States,\" unleashing mass protests at airports nationwide. To keep the peace in that moment, he modified his language. But make no mistake, that ban was the real Trump speaking loud and clear. We heard it in his position on the Central Park Five in 1989 and decades earlier when he and his father systematically refused to rent apartments to Blacks. Today's unhinged, amplified, unencumbered by minimal guardrails Donald J. Trump may seem more radical than ever. But he is the same as he's always been; even more so. It's said that once people reach the age of 70, their only change is to become more the way they are. So it is with Trump. Though the media refuses to call him a demagogue, that is what he is, plain and simple. Each day more people are taking notice, though apparently not yet enough to put him in jail for inciting the insurrection attempt on January 6, 2021.  Dr. Lance Dodes, who is a retired assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a training and supervising analyst emeritus at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, shared the following insights with me via email:  When a person has a chronic illness, we all know to expect recurrence of symptoms of that problem. Donald Trump is a permanent, chronic psychopath who has repeatedly demonstrated an inability to be empathic with other human beings, a frightening need to dominate, control and destroy others, an inability to tolerate criticism or accept any defeat, an utter disregard for facts and the truth, endless lying, and clear delusions, insisting things are true that are demonstrably and unquestionably false. As with other permanent conditions, these aspects of his psychopathic personality will not change. Trump's behavior is worse now but that's only because we're seeing a peeling away of his façade as he becomes more desperate; his actions and speech will continue to show more of what he really is. He's already saying he will call out the National Guard to suppress dissent, as dictators have done forever, and it would be no surprise if eventually, like Saddam Hussein when he was finally put on trial, he shouts that he is the one true ruler and any effort to hold him accountable is illegal and immoral. Unfortunately, nations being taken over by psychopathic dictators is common in human history. It happened in Germany, in Iraq, in Russia, and for centuries earlier all over the globe. It could certainly happen to us unless enough people recognize that Trump is psychologically just another Hitler, Stalin, Saddam or the other malignant tyrants throughout history.  The picture is clear: As the 2024 presidential campaign begins in earnest, Donald Trump will become more dangerous, violent, threatening, unhinged, and his true horrible self, further unmasked and unleashed if such a thing is even possible.  Unfortunately, because of its horse race coverage and other failed norms and approaches to the news and politics in a time of democracy crisis and ascendant neofascism, the American news media will continue with its failed fixations on the \"heroes\" and \"villains\" and \"winners and losers\" of the week, month, and election cycle. In practice, this means that the American mainstream news media will desperately try to find a \"normal\" Republican character to juxtapose with Donald Trump's increasing extremism and radical threats to American society and democracy.  As of now, the mainstream news media has decided that the more \"reasonable\" and \"sane\" and \"traditional\" Republican is Gov. Ron DeSantis. In reality, DeSantis is as least if not more dangerous than Donald Trump. Both are neofascists who want to destroy America's multiracial pluralistic society. The choice between them is a false one because the outcome will be the same: the American people will be made to suffer even more as the fascist fever dream nightmare and its culture of cruelty takes hold even more and threatens to become permanent.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nDonald Trump has become increasingly extreme and dangerous in his rhetoric and behavior as the 2024 Election approaches. \nMental health experts have warned that Trump's behavior is a sign of collective pathology and other maladaptive behavior on a societal scale.\nThe mainstream news media is normalizing Trump's behavior by focusing on the \"heroes\" and \"villains\" of the election cycle.\nRon DeSantis is as least if not more dangerous than Donald Trump, and the choice between them is a false one.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article examines the increasingly dangerous rhetoric and behavior of Donald Trump as he prepares to run for president in 2024.\nIt argues that the mainstream news media has normalized Trump's behavior and failed to accurately communicate the threat he poses to American democracy.\nMental health experts are quoted to explain Trump's behavior from a psychoanalytic perspective, and it is argued that Trump is a permanent, chronic psychopath who will only become more dangerous as his campaign progresses.\nThe article also warns that the choice between Trump and other Republicans like Ron DeSantis is a false one, as both are neofascists who want to destroy America's multiracial pluralistic society."

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 President of the United States Donald Trump speaking at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland. Image Credit: Gage Skidmore.  Yes, Donald Trump is on 'Fire' mode to try and win the 2024 election. And he was on display during a recent Fox News townhall.  Whatever happened to conservative pugilist Sean Hannity?  Yes, the Fox News host still has a show on the right-wing network, but he seems to have lost his touch and influence in the Republican party.  To reacquire some of that mojo, Hannity permitted Donald Trump to have his second town hall of the 2024 presidential campaign on the network, and host.  Hannity Runs a Different Kind of Forum  Hannity said he would have a different event than the one Trump took part in during a recent town hall held by CNN. The commentator said he would allow Trump to speak without the interruptions and pushback that the former president endured from the CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins.  “One thing I will tell you, this town hall is not going to be like fake news CNN,” Hannity said on his radio show on June 1. “I am not there to debate the candidate,” he explained. “I am not there to argue with the candidate, I am there to ask questions and let the candidate give their answer and let the audience ask their questions. That's my job tonight. That will be a great distinction.”  Trump Quickly Pounds Biden  During the Fox town hall, Trump was on fire. The former president said the country was suffering under Biden and that he would fix these ailments within “six months” on the job. Trump said he would alleviate the Southern Border crisis, bring law and order to the United States, and reduce inflation and gas prices.  As for the war in Ukraine, Trump said he could create a ceasefire and pathway to peace in “24 hours.” He also claimed that Russia’s Vladimir Putin would have never invaded Ukraine if he were still president.  Donald Trump Addresses Classified Document Scandal  Hannity did ask Trump at least one tough question about a recording that was reportedly obtained by the Department of Justice that purported to show that Trump may have known that a classified document that he referred to in a meeting should have been returned to the National Archives.  “I don't know anything about it,” Trump said when asked if he recognizes any details about the recording. “All I know is, everything I did was right.”  The town hall with Hannity revealed much of the Trump playbook for his presidential campaign. First, deny that he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. Then obfuscate and parry anyone who tries to push back on that claim.  What Issues Will Trump Run On  He wants to fix the border and reduce illegal immigration. Trump will make himself a caped crusader when addressing crime in the cities. He prefers to address pocket issues and help people who are having difficulty making ends meet during high inflation and interest rates. And, for foreign policy, he wants to solve the Ukraine problem.  That is more than five issues that he is pursuing. Campaigns typically focus on three so Trump has created more red meat for his followers. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis must address these issue areas too, not to mention the large field of candidates who mostly do not want to speak out against Trump at this time.  The former president is also running a more professional campaign. He is using town halls adroitly to get his message across while DeSantis and others have not been able to schedule nationally televised events. South Carolina senator and White House hopeful Tim Scott has booked an appearance on The View talk show that should help him get his message out on the big stage. But other candidates have so far not enjoyed such forums.  Trump also doesn’t have to spend time, money, and resources introducing himself or improving name recognition. He can go on the warpath against other candidates with negative rejoinders, then switch to his messaging regarding his views about the country.  Campaigns are about the future and Trump will have plenty of time to explain his vision for the United States to fix the problems he believes are hurting the nation. Sean Hannity has helped Trump achieve some of the former president’s campaign goals. It remains to be seen if other candidates will get a chance to give town halls too so they can take on Trump successfully.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  Under heavy criticism, CNN’s Anderson Cooper recently delivered a solemn monologue defending his network’s decision to air its Donald Trump town hall event in New Hampshire. “But do you think staying in your silo and only listening to people you agree with is going to make that person go away?” Cooper asked his audience.  Meanwhile, CNN Chairman Chris Licht claimed that the town hall had served America “very well” by helping clarify what the “stakes are in this election.” In other words, the town hall was in the public interest because it educated the public about a controversial but important figure worth listening to, even for those who disagree with him.  Unfortunately, this is a long way from accurately describing Donald Trump.  One problem with CNN’s attempt to defend a media debacle with media sanctimony about educating the public is that we have long since passed the point where anyone, supporters or opponents, needs an education about Donald Trump. In 2016, there was still uncertainty about how Trump would behave if elected president. At this point, aside from any just-awakened Rip Van Winkles, we already know.  Another problem with CNN’s self-congratulatory attitude is that its inept staging undercut the effectiveness of its own town hall moderator, “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins. The network stocked the audience with Trump supporters, which may have been part of a necessary condition for CNN to land the Trump town hall in the first place.  But when Trump denied the outcome of the 2020 election and smeared E. Jean Carroll, whom he had just been found liable for sexually battering, the audience’s jeering laughter and applause (New Hampshire Republican Governor Chris Sununu called them “completely embarrassing”) interfered with Collins’s efforts to fact-block him. When a network like CNN stages a quasi-campaign event for Trump’s Johnstown Flood of lies, such as his proclamation that the Jan. 6 rioters had “love in their hearts,” how does the public benefit?  Above all, CNN’s defense fails to address the unique dilemma in covering Trump. Although free speech is the “lifeblood of democracy,” Trump, by repeatedly and falsely attacking the outcome of the 2020 election and American democracy in general (“this was a rigged election…we have elections that were horrible ”) uses his free speech privilege to undermine support for democracy. And that support may be in play because, according to one poll, 42 percent of Republicans and 31 percent of Democrats say they prefer a strong unelected leader to a weak elected one. This may just be Trump’s ideal political environment.  Trump isn’t just telling run-of-the-mill lies. His stolen election claim has been characterized by Yale University history professor Timothy Snyder as the lie “so big that it reorders the world. And so part of the telling the lie is that you immediately say that it’s the other side that is telling the lie.”  Where is the public benefit to giving a friendly forum to the big lie that erodes American democracy?  No one is arguing that the media should stop covering Trump, but we do need a robust debate over how to cover him better. Trump can be covered as a news event by networks with reporters or anchors who call out his lies without a sneering audience and with on-screen chyrons and tweets that provide accurate facts to viewers in real time. If Trump is the Republican nominee, there is certainly a role for presidential debates where the moderator, and presumably President Biden as the Democratic nominee, call out Trump’s lies under a “hold the applause” rule.  Even then, Trump won’t be easily restrained, but it would be an improvement over what we witnessed last week. CNN and the other networks need to do some serious self-examination about where they will draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable journalism when it comes to Trump.  Gregory J. Wallance, a writer in New York City, was a federal prosecutor under Carter and Reagan. He was part of the ABSCAM prosecution team, which convicted a U.S. senator and six representatives of bribery. His newest book – “Into Siberia: George Kennan’s Epic Journey Through the Brutal, Frozen Heart of Russia” – is due out later this year.

        "text": "As Ukrainian forces continue to set conditions for a long-anticipated counteroffensive, Moscow's pundit class is running short on optimism. Rather than continuing to say that Russia's \"special military operation\" is still going according to plan, Kremlin-controlled media appear to be actively preparing the domestic population to accept further setbacks on the battlefield.  \"Russian federal talk shows and news broadcasts are pointing to all of the Western military aid that Ukraine has received,\" Kateryna Stepanenko of the Institute for the Study of War told Newsweek. \"They really highlight the number of troops trained by NATO countries and the quantity of Western-supplied weapons systems.\"  For more coverage about the war in Ukraine and the new world order, please subscribe to our newsletter, The Frontlines.  Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Western countries have supplied Ukraine with more than $60 billion in direct military aid, from the Javelin anti-tank rockets which helped repel Russia's initial assault on Kyiv last year to the Leopard tanks and Storm Shadow missiles that are just now making their way onto the battlefield.  Additionally, in recent months a collection of 26 countries including the U.S., the U.K., and Poland has put as many as 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers through training courses aimed at improving Kyiv's capacity to engage in combined arms warfare while also performing necessary maintenance work on the increasingly eclectic arsenal it has been receiving from international donors.  The Kremlin-approved message being communicated to Russian viewers seems to leave open the possibility that, following successful Ukrainian counteroffensive operations around Kharkiv last September and in the city of Kherson in November, Moscow expects that the summer of 2023 could see Ukrainian forces taking back territory around Melitopol, Berdyansk, and even in Crimea.  \"A lot of the discussion on Russian television centers on where Ukraine is most likely to focus its counteroffensive operations,\" Stepanenko said. \"They're talking up Ukraine's reconnaissance drones, they're showing lots of footage of Ukrainian strikes in Luhansk using the Storm Shadow missiles they recently received from the U.K., they're hyping the threat to Crimea, and they're aggressively tapping into Russians' fear of NATO and their fear of so-called 'Nazis' in Kyiv.\"  However, the Russian media spin is not all doom and gloom.  \"At the same time they're hyping the threat, they're also demonstrating the actions that Russia is taking in order to reduce Ukraine's capacity to achieve a major breakthrough,\" Stepanenko explained. \"They very frequently show the footage of recent Russian missile strikes that they claim have destroyed Ukrainian military facilities and tell viewers at home that these events have at least delayed the counteroffensive.\"  \"If it turns out that Ukraine isn't able to move forward, Kremlin propaganda will be able to fall back on the line that it was Russian missile strikes and defensive preparations which saved the day,\" she said. \"But if there do in fact end up being Russian military failures, then as long as those failures aren't catastrophic, the population won't be taken by surprise the way they were last September after the Ukrainian liberation of Kharkiv region.\"  According to figures with firsthand knowledge of how the Kremlin-controlled media ecosystem operates, such messaging would not be making it onto Russian television screens without the consent of the authorities. Rather than representing outbursts from rogue talk show guests, the narrative that Ukraine now represents a legitimate military threat to Russia—a stark contrast to the idea that Russian forces could still seize Kyiv in three days if they actually desired to do so—is being communicated to Russian audiences intentionally.  © Satellite image ©2023 Maxar Technologies Satellite imagery captured by Maxar Technologies on May 15, 2023, provides a snapshot of the destruction wrought in Bakhmut, Ukraine since August of last year. Although Vladimir Putin justified the launch of Russia's \"special military operation\" based in part on the unsubstantiated claim that Russian speakers in places like Bakhmut were being persecuted by the authorities in Kyiv, fifteen months of full-scale war have taken a disproportionate toll on Ukraine's predominantly Russian-speaking southern and eastern regions, with most of the damage to civilian infrastructure having been caused by Russian artillery and rocket strikes.

This does not mean that those whose voices do get transmitted to the Russian domestic audience are painting a rosy picture. Instead, they are simply transmitting the rosiest picture possible under the circumstances.  \"Even hardened patriots are confessing that the Ukrainian counteroffensive is likely to be successful to some extent, but the caveat they insert is that it still won't be fatal for the Russian war effort,\" Sinelnikov-Orishak said.  \"They argue that Ukraine has overpromised its prospects of success, both to its own people and to its Western partners, and that when Ukrainian gains on the battlefield prove to be less than what was hoped for, it will be so demoralizing to Kyiv that the end result will be a Russian victory of sorts,\" he added. \"The talk shows have become a kind of televised psychological therapy session.\"  According to Sinelnikov-Orishak, the on-screen reality demonstrates the limits of the Kremlin's capacity to bend reality to its will, even domestically. However, he still sees the potential for such information operations to help prop up passive acceptance of Vladimir Putin's \"special military operation\" among the Russian public.  \"If Russian propaganda had the capacity to mobilize, then it wouldn't be so difficult for the military to find volunteers willing to sign contracts,\" he noted. \"However, even if Russian troops are pushed back to the borders of February 24, 2022 and the fighting ends there, it will be said inside Russia that we have 'demilitarized' Ukraine and thus prevented them from launching large scale attacks on Russian territory.\"  \"So long as the Ukrainian counteroffensive does not lead to a convincing defeat for the Russian army,\" he added, \"most Russians will remain convinced that all of this was somehow necessary.\"  Related Articles  Start your unlimited Newsweek trial<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe article discusses how the Russian media is preparing the domestic population to accept further setbacks on the battlefield in the war in Ukraine.\nIt also highlights the amount of military aid Ukraine has received from Western countries, and how the Kremlin-controlled media is discussing the potential for Ukrainian counteroffensive operations.\nFinally, it explains how the Kremlin-controlled media is attempting to spin the situation in order to maintain public support for the war effort, even if there are military failures.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nWestern countries have supplied Ukraine with more than $60 billion in direct military aid since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. \nRussian media is preparing the domestic population to accept further setbacks on the battlefield. \nRussian propaganda is attempting to prop up passive acceptance of Vladimir Putin's \"special military operation\" among the Russian public. \nSatellite imagery shows the destruction wrought in Bakhmut, Ukraine since August of last year, caused by Russian artillery and rocket strikes."

Biden has ruled out U.S. deliveries of F-16s to Ukraine, but will train Ukrainian pilots. The decision follows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s repeated requests for fighter jets, including from the Netherlands. In February, Ukrainian officials said they had made significant progress in persuading Dutch officials to send F-16s, but Washington’s approval is necessary because of third-party transfer agreements associated with the purchase of the U.S.-made jets. A transfer would require the sign-off of the chairs and ranking minority-party members of relevant U.S. congressional committees. While top GOP contenders for the presidency such as Donald Trump have criticized the scale of U.S. aid for Ukraine, senior Republican leaders in Congress have been supportive of it throughout the war. Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe. F-16s Secretary of State Antony Blinken was a major force within the administration in pushing to allow U.S. allies to make the transfers and had also worked extensively with countries within NATO to move the policy forward, said U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. and had also worked extensively with countries within NATO to move the policy forward, said U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.

        "text": "© Provided by MSNBC From left, former President Donald Trump sits with his attorneys Joe Tacopina and Boris Epshteyn inside the courtroom during his arraignment at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City, on April 4, 2023.  The attorney-client relationship is historically one of the most sacred, cloaked with the (usually) impenetrable privilege of complete confidentiality and one that is imbued with explicit and implicit trust. Clients look to their lawyers for guidance, a keen knowledge of the law, and the ability to provide favorable public-facing content for those moments and cases where the client cannot interface with the media and the public. There are professional standards and each state has rules of conduct.  But when it comes to the many cases of former President Donald Trump, those sacred bonds are sometimes bent to the point of breaking. Who’s to blame? Depends on who you ask, I suspect. But regardless of where the fault may lie, this kind of havoc does not bode well for Trump’s legal future. When faced with so many legal challenges, a surgically orchestrated strategy is necessary. Sometimes, even just the outward image of prepared and organized calm is the goal. But with Trump, you have the perfect storm of infighting lawyers jostling for pole position and a client who is prone to embracing the microphone and never meeting a camera he didn’t love. It’s a recipe for an attorney-client disaster.  Trump presently has several pending cases and investigations, both state and federal:  He is being prosecuted by way of a 34-count felony indictment by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, led by Alvin Bragg, charging him with falsification of business records relating to payments made to Trump’s former “fixer” and personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to reimburse Cohen for a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. That case was just set for trial in March 2024.  After being found civilly liable for $5 million in damages by a New York jury of his peers for the sexual abuse and defamation of E. Jean Carroll, Trump is now facing the prospect of an amended complaint (to include statements made after the verdict in another case) for his earlier defamation of Carroll in June 2019, when he was president of the United States.  New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a $250 million civil lawsuit against Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization, accusing them of falsely inflating the value of assets in order to defraud insurers and lenders. Trump has been deposed twice now in that case; the first time he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times.  Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith presently has at least two investigations into the twice-impeached Trump: (1) allegations of improper and illegal retention of classified materials once his presidency was terminated and (2) allegations of Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in various states, including Georgia.  In Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is pursuing an investigation into Trump’s alleged attempts to extort officials in the state into overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election and to install a fake slate of electors to vote for Trump over the lawfully elected Joe Biden.  And to be clear, these are the cases and investigations about which we are aware. There could be other investigations that are underway about which we have no knowledge at this stage. Considering all of the above, you would think a client facing that amount of legal peril would have a top-notch team of lawyers in place to defend him. But when you have a client like Trump, normal expectations don’t apply.  Just recently, attorney Tim Parlatore announced — very publicly, via voluntarily testifying for the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation — that he was resigning from the Trump legal team, allegedly because of his inability to provide the right kind of counsel to Trump due to obstacles created by fellow Trump lawyer Boris Epshteyn. Parlatore claims that Epshteyn was keeping him and other lawyers from being able to speak to Trump and that Epshteyn was not being honest with their client.  Interestingly, it was just a few months ago that Parlatore was singing Epshteyn’s praises, according to The New York Times, whom he told, “It’s good to have someone who’s a lawyer who is also inside the palace gates.” It doesn’t bode well that only a few months after that, Parlatore publicly derided Epshteyn and said Epshteyn was gatekeeping the rest of the legal team from accessing their one client (Trump).  Parlatore also went after fellow Trump attorney Joe Tacopina for what Parlatore said was a “potential conflict of interest” in Tacopina representing Trump in the Manhattan district attorney's office Stormy Daniels hush money criminal case. At one time, Daniels had contacted Tacopina about possibly representing her and Parlatore questioned openly on cable news whether Tacopina was the “right” attorney to represent Trump at trial.  Although Epshteyn has been referred to as Trump’s in-house counsel, Parlatore told The New York Times he has reportedly little documented legal experience, including none in the criminal defense arena. Epshteyn has created a name for himself in MAGA circles for being a political strategist, for his combative style and for his access to Trump. Trump also has apparently given Epshteyn the ability to hire and fire attorneys.  Parlatore isn’t the only attorney on Trump’s Keystone Cops legal team to throw up the white flag. Evan Corcoran, who was Trump’s lead attorney regarding the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation, resigned from that role after being subpoenaed by the Justice Department to testify before a federal grand jury. Granted, Corcoran remains on the global legal team as counsel for Trump, but it isn’t a commonplace occurrence for an attorney to end up being compelled by way of court order to testify before a grand jury regarding conduct committed by a client. Lest Corcoran feel lonely, though, Parlatore has also provided testimony before Jack Smith’s federal grand jury for his role in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. However, Parlatore chose to appear voluntarily before the grand jury without the need for a subpoena to give testimony about how additional document searches were conducted at other Trump properties.  Pat A. Cipollone, former Trump White House counsel, and Patrick Philbin, former deputy White House counsel, have also testified before a federal grand jury about Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Oh, and Epshteyn? He has testified before Fani Willis’ Fulton County special grand jury regarding Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.  Corcoran also has the dubious honor of being the subject of piercing attorney-client privilege because of the crime-fraud exception for his communications — both written and verbal — with Trump. The successful application of the crime-fraud exception is rare. A few federal judges, as well as some appellate court judges, have found that there was sufficient evidence of criminal activity afoot. If I were Corcoran, I would vacate the premises of Trump world in its entirety. I am of course not counsel to Corcoran, although to be clear, several Trump lawyers have had to retain their own lawyers due to their representation of Trump. The newest iteration of “MAGA” might as well now stand for “Making Attorneys Get Attorneys.”  Notable examples include Christina Bobb, who was interviewed by the FBI for her role in signing off on the certification representing that there were no more classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, despite further evidence proving that certification was not true. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal counsel, has had to retain several lawyers because of his own exposure, both criminal and civil, after representing Trump over the years.  Let’s also not forget other former Trump lawyers like Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis and John Eastman, all of whom are facing ethics complaints affecting their ability to practice law in various jurisdictions, as well as several investigations for their roles as Trump’s counsel. In some instances and depending upon the findings by various referees and judges in these different jurisdictions that are investigating former Trump lawyers, these attorneys could lose their licenses to practice law.  Trump runs his mouth unfettered and unedited and uncontrolled. He spent considerable time during a recent town hall on CNN stating for all to hear, including prosecutors far and wide, that he took classified documents from the White House, and he took the opportunity to potentially defame Carroll further.  If he’s being given legal advice not to talk, he is clearly not listening or he doesn’t respect the counsel being dispensed. Historically, Trump has done and said whatever he wants, presumably regardless of the legal advice being provided by his dozens of attorneys. And oftentimes that has occurred to his legal peril. When facing multiple cases and multiple investigations, some of which could result in years of incarceration in prison, a client like Trump should not be speaking publicly about the facts of a case or the circumstances underlying the basis of an investigation. But Trump? He’ll go on national TV and do it anyway.  It's interesting that throughout all of the dirty laundry airing of the inner turmoil regarding his legal team, Trump has remained unusually quiet. Trump himself has not come forward to voice his support for any one attorney. So the public continues, with a combination of fascination and disgust, to watch the train wreck that is Trump Legal World unfold like a political iteration of The Hunger Games.

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Excalibur Guided Howitzer Round. Image Credit: Creative Commons.  The war in Ukraine is becoming the transformative event of the 21st century?  Putin's illegal invasion is draining his armed forces by the day, and some experts think he could lose the war.  And we know one thing: social media will be one of the best ways to get a sense of who is winning or losing over the longterm:  Social Media Shows Us the Ukraine War Up Close  In a video shared to social media this weekend, an M982 Excalibur extended-range guided artillery shell could be seen easily slicing through a Russian D-20 152mm towed howitzer on the left bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson Oblast.  The U.S.-made Excalibur is a GPS and inertial-guided munition that is capable of being employed in close support situations within 75 to 150 meters (250 to 490 feet) of friendly troops.  It was a prime example of \"one shot, one kill.\"  The type of weapon that fired the round isn't known, but it was likely from a UK-supplied M777 155mm howitzer.  The M982 Excalibur can be used in poor weather with bad visibility, while the high-explosive round can also be delayed to penetrate buildings or bunkers. It has been widely employed to target Russian artillery.  Too Much?  Yet, it may have been a bit of \"overkill,\" and some commentators to the post from Ukraine Weapons Tracker (@UAWeapons) – which shared the video – suggested the M982 Excalibur ordnance was likely as costly as the platform it took out.  Russia had more than 1,000 of its D-20 152mm howitzers in service when it launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine last year, and an untold number have already been destroyed. Not clear in the video was whether the platform seen targeted by Kyiv's forces was still operational or if it had been disabled. The gun-howitzer is typically operated by a crew of eight soldiers; yet, none appeared present at the time of the strike.  It has been suggested that the crew spotted the drone that recorded the incident and which likely acted as a spotter for the Ukrainian artillery. It is also possible the gun was disabled and was used as a decoy – in which case, Kyiv wasted one of the expensive Excalibur rounds.  The D-20 and Its Derivatives  As noted, the Kremlin had more than 1,000 D-20 howitzers in service, but Kyiv's forces also had a significant number in its arsenals, and it has likely bolstered its strength from those captured by Russian forces.  The D-20 has a proven combat record, first seeing service in the Vietnam War, while it was later employed by Syrian forces in the Six-Day War and later in the Yom Kippur War. However, it wasn't until the Soviet-Afghan War that Kremlin forces first fired the D-20 in anger.  It is now being used by both Russian and Ukrainian forces.  In addition, the Ukrainian Army has begun to receive a number of M1981 artillery pieces, a derivative of the Soviet D-20. Both are manually loaded howitzers. The M1981 was designed by the Romanian Arsenalul Armatei (Army Arsenal) and was first manufactured under license at the Romanian Reșita plant. It weighs 5.7 tons, features a longer rifled barrel (34 calibers long), but can use the same ordnance as the Soviet-developed weapon.

        "text": "Four teenagers have been charged in the murder of a beloved 24-year-old Chicago police officer, after one of the teens allegedly confessed his involvement to a friend as detectives listened in, according to court documents.  Officer Aréanah Preston had just finished her shift and was still in uniform when she was shot and killed at about 1:42 a.m. Saturday, according to Chicago police.  © WLS A poster of Chicago police officer Areanah Preston is seen at a press conference on May 10, 2023.  The four suspects \"were out looking for victims\" that night and are believed to be connected to multiple robberies and a car theft in the hours leading up to Preston's murder, interim Chicago Police Superintendent Eric Carter said at a news conference. The teens, dressed in black and wearing masks, were all armed with guns, according to court documents.  As Preston was returning home, the teens pulled up in a stolen car, and at least two of the teens allegedly fired at her, according to police.  Preston returned fire, but the teens continued to shoot, and they allegedly stole Preston's gun before fleeing, Carter said.  Preston's gun has not been recovered, police said.  Carter said Preston was a \"beloved, daughter, sister and friend who wanted to make a difference in this world\" and \"create a better future for Chicago.\"  The four suspects -- Trevell Breeland, 19; Joseph Brooks, 19; Jakwon Buchanan, 18; and Jaylan Frazier, 16 -- were all charged with first-degree murder and face other charges, including armed robbery and arson, police said. The 16-year-old is charged as an adult, police said.  On Saturday night, hours after Preston was killed, the 16-year-old suspect allegedly confessed his involvement to a friend. The 16-year-old asked the friend if he'd seen Preston's murder on the news, and claimed \"that was his work,\" according to court documents.  The 16-year-old allegedly told the friend \"they were out robbing people when they saw a single female in her car. They were going to rob her but the female shot at them,\" and then \"one of the guys he was with shot back,\" according to court documents.  After hearing this, the 16-year-old's friend went to the police, according to the court documents.  With detectives listening in, the friend called the 16-year-old suspect back on speaker phone. On that call, the 16-year-old suspect made \"additional admissions to the robbery and shooting including details that had not been released,\" court documents said.  On Monday, in a call with his mom, the 16-year-old allegedly \"made admissions to participating in the robberies and being present for the murder,\" court documents said. On Tuesday, the 16-year-old allegedly told his mom that they had sold Preston's gun, court documents said.  Brooks, one of the 19-year-old suspects, allegedly admitted that Preston reached for her gun but \"he shot first\" toward her and then \"fired a number of rounds at her,\" court documents said.  The suspects were denied bail at a bond hearing on Wednesday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. The teens are set to return to court on May 30.

        "text": "When I played in Europe, I used to get asked the same question a lot from my teammates in the locker room:  “Why does America have so many shootings?”  I got asked that every time a mass shooting incident made the news across the Atlantic, which was seemingly every other week, right? And, honestly, I didn’t know how to respond.  “We have the second amendment.... It is what it is.”  That’s the way I thought about it. There wasn’t a way to fix it. There was certainly nothing I could do about it. I think, like a lot of people, I was in a bubble and I was kinda numb to it.  But travel opens your mind like nothing else. I left the States to play soccer abroad straight after college and only returned in 2016. Struggling to find answers for those questions as a young player in locker rooms across Europe changed my perspective.  My teammates came from countries where they don’t have to worry about gun violence. It just isn’t an issue. My wife is Norwegian. She’s from a place where, for the most part, you don’t have to think about locking your door, let alone plan exit strategies every time you go into a public space, or worry about your kids’ safety at school. When we first met in France, she would ask me the same questions as my teammates.  Look, before we get into it, I don’t want this article to be anti-America. It’s not about that. I’m not about that. I think America is a great country, but we are also the only developed country with this level of gun violence. Mass shootings? School shootings? No one else comes close. We’re an anomaly. That’s a fact. And there are plenty of other great countries out there that we can learn from, because what we are dealing with is an epidemic.  This is a complex issue, for sure, but it’s not enough to accept it and say, “It is what it is.”  There’s a question that we, as Americans, need to ask:  Why do we live like this?  © Philadelphia Union Philadelphia Union  When the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School happened in February 2018, it was a turning point for me.  I grew up in Weston, in South Florida. Parkland was literally 15 minutes away from where I lived. I knew the community. When the news came in, I had a vivid picture in my mind of the actual building and the sports complex. I relived the times I played soccer against Douglas and the countless pickup games I played on those fields with friends that went to school there.  It felt so close.  I think you can get accustomed to seeing these terrible stories on the news and thinking that it’d never happen to you, your neighborhood. Let me tell you, if it can happen here in Parkland, it can happen anywhere. This was an affluent neighborhood. I’m talking gated communities, upper-middle-income families, a really good school. It’s not the place you’d ever imagine anything bad happening.  Of course, regardless of the neighborhood, this kind of senseless tragedy shouldn’t happen anywhere. Period.  Even more personal than my own connection was the fact that one of my teammates at the Union lost one of his best friends that day. That hit hard.  Something in my psyche clicked. It wasn’t enough to just keep on having conversations among ourselves in the locker room. I knew I needed to use whatever platform I have to do something.  I started voicing my opinion on social media and becoming more informed. I joined Everytown For Gun Safety — America’s largest gun violence prevention organization.  I knew there would be some backlash, some Twitter trolls and “shut up and dribble” style comments, but I’ve been around long enough to put that to one side. Yeah, I’m a soccer player, but before that I’m a father. I’m a husband. I’m a neighbor. I’m a community member. We need to talk about this stuff. Some things really are bigger than sports.  When I went “viral” after grabbing the mic and yelling my message to Congress on the field after scoring against D.C. United in August 2019, it wasn’t something I’d planned — if you know my game you’ll know I never score and I didn’t even know if the mic was hot — but it just felt like the right thing to do in the moment.  Yeah, I’m a soccer player, but before that I’m a father. I’m a husband. I’m a neighbor. I’m a community member. We need to talk about this stuff. Some things really are bigger than sports.Alejandro Bedoya  We’d just witnessed the massacres in El Paso and Dayton within 24 hours of each other that week. It was the only thing on the news in my hotel room before the game. I couldn’t not think about it.  The response I received after the game was overwhelming. I got a lot of private messages from survivors as well as from family members of those who were lost. Reading their stories was gut-wrenching — these people who had been through unimaginable tragedy and felt that their voices weren’t being heard. That pushed me to continue speaking out and being an advocate for change.  I’ll never accept that this is just a part of life. I’ve got two kids of my own. I can’t allow this stuff to be normalized for them.  I saw a video just the other day of six-year-olds(!!!) talking with their parents about the roles they have to play at school in case of an active shooter. One has to move the desk here, the other has to lock the door, another has to open a closet.  The idea that this is the reality we are living in … wow, I don’t even know what to say.  Show that video to anyone in any other developed country and ask what they think.  It’s bonkers.  Twice in my life I’ve had the experience of getting text messages telling me and my wife that my kids’ day-care center had gone into lockdown due to situations around the facility — once because of a shooting nearby and once because of a suspicious person in the area. As a parent those moments are terrifying. How can you not fear the worst? A shiver goes up your spine, your heart starts racing and your mind goes to places you don’t want it to go.  I’ll say it very clearly: Parents should not have to send kids to school fearing that they may never come home.  Kids should not have to worry about lockdown drills like they’re spending their day in some prison, rather than a safe space of learning.  No one should have to plan an exit strategy every time they go to the grocery store, the theater, or their place of worship.  How is that freedom? How is that America?  © Philadelphia Union Philadelphia Union  Philadelphia has struggled with the issue of gun violence alongside poverty and inequality for a long time. And in the last few years it’s only gotten worse.  Honestly, when we moved here after I joined the Union in 2016, some of the realities my wife was confronted with as a foreigner came as a complete culture shock. And it’s heartbreaking, because I love Philly. It’s the only place I’ve put down roots in my adult life. It’s where my kids are growing up.  I love its vibrancy and diversity. In many ways, I think Philly embodies the American dream. It’s blue-collar, hardworking and resilient — those are all the qualities I try to display as a soccer player. There’s a grittiness to the city. The people can be blunt — if you have a bad game, they’ll tell you all about it, but I love that too! Because the people here care. They have such passion for their sports teams and for their community.  It’s also a city at the forefront of a lot of positive change socially and culturally, and I’m proud to play my part. I was fortunate enough to be asked to be a part of the Philadelphia Equity Alliance, which formed after George Floyd. It’s a group that involves a bunch of major business, community and civic leaders in the city with the mission of making Philly a safer and more equitable place to live.  One of the programs I have been involved with through the mayor’s office and the city of Philadelphia is called Group Violence Intervention (GVI) — which is an evidence-based approach that uses community members to engage directly with the small percentage of the population who are most at risk of becoming involved in gun violence.  In a nutshell, it’s an outreach program focussed on deterrence, targeting individuals who are most susceptible to getting involved in gun crime and offering them pathways to counseling, education, social services and even employment opportunities — which is huge.  The whole thing is driven by the community — through the involvement of teachers, clergy, parents, churchgoers, police and those with lived experience as victims or perpetrators of gun violence.  It can be very powerful. And more than that, it works. I've seen first-hand the data from the folks who are behind it, showing that it is making lives better in Philadelphia. A University of Pennsylvania study actually just came out that showed that there was a 38.6% reduction in gun violence per week in those communities where GVI is deployed.  This stuff takes a big collaborative effort and it’s so important to have a major MLS sponsor like Audi supporting the Philadelphia Equity Alliance through the Audi Goals Drive Progress fund.  © Alyssa Greenberg for The Players' Tribune Alyssa Greenberg for The Players' Tribune  When I was coming through as a young player, it was still rare for professional athletes to speak out on social issues or to get involved with advocacy. A lot of players worried about doing anything that might hurt their career down the line. But I’m grateful that the dynamic has shifted. We’re in a place now where athletes are not only much more comfortable engaging in discussions on the issues that really matter, but they also are actually being backed by their clubs, the leagues and sponsors, who are having a real positive impact by spotlighting and helping to finance causes like this.  Listen, we still need a lot of change. There’s a long way to go. We need more support for programs like the GVI in Philadelphia and we need lawmakers across the country to pass more common sense gun laws that the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of Americans want. But we have made strides in recent years.  I was at the White House last year when the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was signed by President Biden. That’s the first time in 30 years that major gun safety legislation has been passed in this country. That’s a huge step in the right direction.  I don’t demand anything of anyone, but the one thing I’ve learned from working with Everytown and the community groups in Philadelphia is that people have power. Everybody’s voice matters. Your voice matters. I’ve seen the rhetoric improve since the days when I began speaking out. People aren’t just accepting that “it is what it is” anymore. A lot of that is down to the younger generation. It’s so encouraging to look at their attitudes and how they are using the full power of social media and peaceful demonstration to drive change. Kids growing up now aren’t stuck in the same old ways of thinking and they’re fed up with a lack of change from their politicians and lawmakers. They won’t stand for it. That's why, despite everything, I feel optimistic.  In the end, this isn’t even a partisan issue. We all want the same things, right?  We all want to go to school, to work, to enjoy movies, to shop, to pray – free from fear.  Personally, I hope my kids end up traveling like I did.  There’s really no better education.  And when they’re old enough, whatever year that is, wherever they go, my hope is that they don’t get asked the same question I did.  I hope we have come to our senses.  I am tired of not being able to answer the question ...  Why???  The Audi Goals Drive Progress program will continue to support those making an impact off the pitch through financial contributions to nonprofit organizations that create sustainable communities, foster equity and inclusion, and enrich the lives of those in need.

        "text": "© KPCW.org via Associated Press Kouri Richins at the KPCW studio in Park City, Utah, on April 12, 2023. Kouri Richins at the KPCW studio in Park City, Utah, on April 12, 2023. KPCW.org via Associated Press  Police say Kouri Richins killed her husband by poisoning his drink with fentanyl.  Before the killing, prosecutors say Richins took out life insurance policies on her husband.  After her husband's death, Richins wrote a children's book about dealing with grief.  A Utah woman who police say killed her husband before she wrote a children's book about grief is now accused of also taking out $2 million in life insurance policies on him before his death.  Police charged Kouri Richins, 33, with aggravated murder and three counts of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute earlier this month.  Investigators said in court documents that Richins had mixed a Moscow Mule for her husband, Eric Richins, that contained five times the lethal dosage of fentanyl.  According to court documents, police said Richins bought the lethal drug — which she called \"some of the Michael Jackson stuff\" — through an acquaintance for $900.  Prosecutors on Thursday filed an amended document that also accuses Richins of taking out life insurance policies on her husband before his death, according to NBC News.  In the documents, the state alleges that Eric Richins found out his wife had taken more than $100,000 from his bank account, a $250,000 home equity line of credit on their home, and spent $30,000 on his credit cards in September 2020, NBC reported.  The document says that Richins took out several life insurance policies against her husband between 2015 and 2017 totaling more than $2 million, which he did not know about, according to the outlet.  The filing states that in October 2020, Eric consulted with a divorce attorney and changed his will to put his estate under the control of his sister, designating her as the beneficiary of his $500,000 personal life insurance policy, according to NBC.  The new filing also says that Richins tried to poison her husband on previous occasions, NBC reported. Prosecutors say that Richins left her husband a sandwich in his car on Valentine's Day with a love letter that caused him to break out in hives shortly after eating it, the outlet reported.  \"Eric found his son's EpiPen and administered it to himself and slept,\" the document says.  Eric thought his wife had tried to poison him and told a friend about his suspicion but decided to stay with her for the sake of his children, the state says according to NBC.  Richins' children's book — titled \"Are You With Me?\" — was published on March 5.  The book is meant to help children cope with the death of a loved one. While promoting the book on a local television show, Richins said it was meant to help kids \"find happiness some way or another.\"  \"My husband passed away unexpectedly last year ... it completely took us all by shock,\" she said on Good Things Utah. \"I'm trying to understand not only how to grieve as a widow, as a wife, but also with my kids, how to help them understand what just happened.\"  The book is no longer available on Amazon, but a previous description said it was written \"by a loving mother who personally faced this challenge, this book is designed to offer comfort and solace to young minds in a way that is both accessible and engaging.\"<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nKouri Richins, 33, has been charged with aggravated murder and three counts of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute after police say she poisoned her husband with fentanyl.\nProsecutors allege that Richins had taken out life insurance policies on her husband before his death, and had also tried to poison him on previous occasions.\nRichins wrote a children's book about grief after her husband's death, titled \"Are You With Me?\n\", which was meant to help children cope with the death of a loved one.\nThe book is no longer available on Amazon.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nKouri Richins is accused of killing her husband by poisoning his drink with fentanyl and taking out life insurance policies on him before his death. \nProsecutors allege that Richins had previously tried to poison her husband on multiple occasions.\nRichins wrote a children's book about grief after her husband's death.\nThe book was meant to help children cope with the death of a loved one."

        "text": "© Provided by Salon Donald TrumpShane Bevel/NCAA Photos via Getty Images  Special counsel Jack Smith's team has obtained lawyer notes showing that former President Donald Trump was warned that he could not keep any classified documents in response to a subpoena he failed to comply with last year, according to The Guardian.  Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran, who was ordered to testify before a grand jury by a judge after prosecutors pierced his attorney-client privilege claims, conveyed the previously unreported warning to the former president last year, according to the report. The warning \"could be significant\" in Smith's probe because it shows that he was aware of his subpoena obligations, according to the report.  \"Trump knew. He's always known,\" tweeted MSNBC legal analyst Katie Phang.  The warning was included in about 50 pages of contemporaneous notes written by Corcoran.  Corcoran in June found about 40 classified documents in a Mar-a-Lago storage room. He met with Justice Department investigators and later drafted a letter affirming that no other materials were at the property. But the FBI later found about 100 more classified documents while executing a court-authorized warrant in August.  Prosecutors are investigating whether Trump intentionally sought to obstruct the subpoena. They have particularly \"fixated\" on Trump valet Walt Nauta, who told prosecutors that Trump personally told him to move boxes out of the storage room before and after the subpoena was issued.  Corcoran's notes \"revealed how Trump and Nauta had unusually detailed knowledge of the botched subpoena response, including where Corcoran intended to search and not search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, as well as when Corcoran was actually doing his search,\" according to The Guardian's Hugo Lowell.  Though prosecutors are typically barred from reviewing attorney notes, Corcoran's attorney-client privilege claims were pierced after a judge agreed with prosecutors that Trump may have used Corcoran's legal services to further a crime.  The notes described how Corcoran told Nauta about the subpoena ahead of the search because he needed him to unlock the storage room, which prosecutors have taken a sign that the aide was closely involved in the search, according to the report. Corcoran also wrote that Nauta offered to help him go through the boxes, though the attorney declined.  Corcoran's notes also revealed that the search took several days and there were times when the storage room may have been left unattended during the search, according to the report.  Prosecutors would need to show that Trump instructed Nauta to remove boxes he expressly knew included classified documents covered by a subpoena with the intention of hiding them from his attorney's search, the report noted.  Trump's attorneys have argued that the subpoena response is incomplete because Corcoran was not as thorough as he should have been because he delayed the search and did not realize how many boxes were in the storage room.  Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.  The DOJ interviewed Nauta last year and believed that he was not forthcoming about his account of moving the boxes. Prosecutors threatened to charge Nauta with lying to the FBI after he gave contradictory answers but Nauta stopped cooperating with prosecutors after his lawyer demanded an immunity deal. Prosecutors have since asked other witnesses about what Nauta did with the boxes, according to the report.  \"This is nothing more than a targeted, politically motivated witch-hunt against President Trump that is concocted to meddle in an election and prevent the American people from returning him to the White House,\" a Trump spokesperson told The Guardian.  MSNBC host Mike Brzezinski interviewed Lowell about his report, noting that \"every time I read into this, I'm just shocked at the stupidity of those, honestly, of former President Trump, moving documents in and out of his office before and after the subpoena, and I guess having people do it for him.\"  Lowell explained that the previously unreported warning is a \"problem for the former president.\"  \"And it becomes a problem for his legal team and there's a whole bunch of other stuff in the notes about how the valet had unusually detailed knowledge about where the lawyer was conducting his searches for classified documents,\" he told MSNBC, \"and I think the special counsel's office is looking at this as the core, the heart of the obstruction investigation.\"<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith's team has obtained lawyer notes showing that former President Donald Trump was warned that he could not keep any classified documents in response to a subpoena he failed to comply with last year.\nProsecutors are investigating whether Trump intentionally sought to obstruct the subpoena by having his valet move boxes out of the storage room before and after the subpoena was issued.\nTrump's attorneys have argued that the subpoena response is incomplete because Corcoran was not as thorough as he should have been.\nThe DOJ interviewed Trump's valet and believed that he was not forthcoming about his account of moving the boxes.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe Guardian has reported that former President Donald Trump was warned by his lawyer Evan Corcoran that he could not keep any classified documents in response to a subpoena he failed to comply with last year.\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith's team is investigating whether Trump intentionally sought to obstruct the subpoena, and Corcoran's notes have revealed that Trump and his valet Walt Nauta had detailed knowledge of the botched subpoena response.\nTrump's attorneys have argued that the subpoena response is incomplete, and prosecutors have threatened to charge Nauta with lying to the FBI.\nMSNBC host Mike Brzezinski has commented on the \"stupidity\" of Trump's actions."

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  The reality of the GOP primary race is that former President Donald Trump remains the polling front-runner despite the fact that he has offered no plausible path to victory. In fact, he seems intent on handicapping his campaign at every possible turn.  Nominating Trump would remove the biggest red flag voters see with President Joe Biden’s candidacy: Biden’s age. Trump is just four years younger than Biden, meaning that voters who don’t want a man born in the 1940s to lead the country would not then be flocking to the GOP nominee. Trump actively wants to take Biden’s age off the table, telling Fox News’s Sean Hannity to lay off the issue.  HOW GEORGE SOROS IS SPREADING ADDICTION, DEATH, AND CHAOS ACROSS THE US  Trump also seems content to parrot Democratic talking points rather than GOP proposals. On Thursday, he disparaged the use of the term “woke” to describe left-wing culture war issues in comments indistinguishable from that of a Democrat. This despite the fact that it is one of the most prominent issues cited by GOP primary voters, who are rightly concerned about woke culture warriors taking over schools, universities, and corporations.  He then turned around later that night and decried wokeism in the military, because he is nothing if not wildly inconsistent.  The rest of Trump’s campaign is as coherent as you would think. He wants to make a campaign issue of how Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R-FL) name is pronounced. He said he would only need six months to fix the “deep state,” despite the fact that he already had four years to do exactly that. He has claimed that former New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who turned nursing homes into COVID hot spots and then attempted to cover up the deaths he caused, handled the pandemic better than Florida.  What, exactly, is supposed to be the point of Trump’s campaign? He and his team don’t want to push back on Democrats on cultural issues. He thinks New York is better run than Florida, the state that should be the GOP model for governance and for turning a swing state into a solidly red state. His team is promoting “fake news” CNN as legitimate and trustworthy in order to attack Republicans.  Do Republicans really want a nominee that is going to pal around with establishment media and praise Democrats while letting them run roughshod on culture war issues?  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  That is exactly what Trump is offering. It is always possible that his polling lead collapses when the race actually gets going (it is only June 2023), but if it holds, Republicans are saying that they do, in fact, want a candidate who will fall in line with Democrats and the media and help Republicans lose, and who won't talk about Joe Biden’s age or how Democrats are imposing liberal ideas on children in schools and on normal people through the power of corporations.  All of this to nominate a guy who already lost to Joe Biden. None of Trump’s campaign, or his reason for running, make any sense. If Republicans choose to stay in his corner, they can keep their complaints about losing elections to themselves because it will once again be another self-inflicted injury.

        "text": "© Provided by The Telegraph Russian President Vladimir Putin  Putin is in a panic over the expected Ukrainian counteroffensive, which may already be in its preliminary “battlefield-shaping” stage. He doesn’t know, any more than the rest of us do, when the offensive will be launched, where it will strike or whether it will succeed. What he does know is that if it achieves significant success, his own days might be numbered, with fissures already opening inside the Kremlin and between its most important henchmen.  The Russian army’s thinly stretched troops have been preparing strong defensive positions all along the front line to repel an attack or series of attacks, and planning their own spoiling operations. But, aside from the balance of forces, critically important to Ukraine’s success or failure is morale.  Putin knows it is fragile among his own troops, many of whom don’t know why they are expected to fight a war they don’t even begin to understand. He knows he has to break the morale of Ukrainian soldiers on the battle line and civilians on the home front. That is why he has recently intensified air attacks on cities and towns. They are intended to kill civilians, destroy infrastructure, disrupt the war economy and make life a misery – both for those in the cities and their relatives at the front.  On Saturday night, Russia launched the largest wave of explosive drone strikes since the full-scale invasion began. Fifty-two of the 54 Iranian-supplied Shahed drones were knocked out of the sky. Forty were aimed at Kyiv, the most intensive barrage targeting the city so far, killing one.  The next day, Kyiv, celebrating the 1,541st anniversary of its founding, was straight back to normal. No mass panic, no serious disruption to life. Putin’s attempts to intimidate the Ukrainian people and their leaders simply don’t work. He tried it first in February last year, expecting Kyiv to fall in a matter of days simply with rocket fire and Russian forces heading towards the capital. Like London in the Blitz and later under Hitler’s rain of V1 and V2 rockets, these Russian war crimes have the opposite effect to what is intended, serving only to harden the people’s will to resist.  Ukrainian soldiers at the front know all about the Russian army’s atrocities against local civilians in areas they have occupied, as well as the industrial-scale kidnapping of thousands of children. Determination to keep the Russians from their doors and thrust them back behind their own border makes these troops fight even harder. One of the most common requests of the West that I have heard in Ukraine, from commanders and soldiers, is that our countries don’t put pressure on their government to make an accommodation with Russia. And no Macron-style off-ramp for Putin.  The Russian president doesn’t want peace talks, either – but for very different reasons. How can he agree to stop a war that has achieved so little at such enormous cost in blood and roubles to his own people? But he does want to hold out the false hope of a ceasefire. It is part of a good cop/bad cop strategy that has just been clumsily articulated by Andrei Kelin, the Russian ambassador to London, who threatened escalation in a “new dimension which we do not need and we do not want”, adding, “we can make peace tomorrow”.  These remarks follow Putin’s characteristically duplicitous words a couple of days ago to the Brazilian president, expressing “the openness of the Russian side to dialogue on the political and diplomatic track, which is still blocked by Kyiv and its Western sponsors”.  The objective is to lure Western governments into appeasing Moscow by pulling back on military support in the hope of peace and the fear of an expanded conflict. Chinese officials may have been put to work, as well, with reports that Li Hui, Beijing’s special representative for Eurasian affairs, has urged European diplomats to end the conflict before it escalates further.  As well as recent promises of modern jets for the longer term, Putin is rattled by the continued flow of munitions into Ukraine as it prepares the counteroffensive. That is another reason for the increased frequency of drone attacks against Ukrainian cities – to exhaust air defences and deplete scarce ammo stocks that will be so critical in major offensive operations.  Despite Russia’s diplomatic offensive, Western leaders, now acclimatised to Putin’s standard threats, seem to be holding up strongly, for the moment at least. But as well as providing military and economic support, and resisting fake talk of peace negotiations, they need to be more aggressive in helping Ukraine counter the entirety of Putin’s war effort. One way of doing that is to bear down hard on Russia’s Iranian quartermasters, who have played an important role in Putin’s aggression, supplying drones, deploying troops, promising ballistic missiles and helping Moscow evade sanctions.  Greater resources should now be applied to interdict drone shipments, as well as harsher economic sanctions against Tehran and setting up a tribunal to deal with aiding and abetting Russian war crimes.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  If the shocking 2016 presidential election of Donald J. Trump taught us anything, it should be that voters can still be unpredictable and unpollable, and that millions of them believe that the entrenched elites from both political parties no longer hear their voices or speak for them.  Voters are continually seeking a new champion. Will Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. become such a champion? I believe so — at least as far as the Democratic primary process is concerned.  When that process is final and all the votes from the primaries and caucuses have been tabulated, I believe Kennedy will emerge as the Democratic nominee for president in 2024.  Cue the laughter and pejoratives. Most from the left. Some from the right. In our increasingly polarized times, everything seems to be viewed through the prisms of ideology, tribalism, anger, hate and the outright dismissal of voices in opposition to our own. But if we choose to put down those often-distorted prisms and open our eyes, there are still facts, figures and pragmatic reasons as to why the less obvious (or the most ridiculed) might still be the correct answer.  My first reason for predicting a Kennedy nomination is that I am still not convinced President Joe Biden will actually run for reelection, primarily because of concerns regarding his advanced age and the perception of cognitive decline.  With regard to Biden’s age being a roadblock to a 2024 campaign, we have this from former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who was asked about it at the Financial Times Weekend Festival: “His age is an issue. And people have every right to consider it.”  In a Quinnipiac poll out this week, 65 percent of voters said they think Biden, 80, is too old for a second term. That’s a share that could very well continue to rise.  But for the moment, Biden has declared his intention to run for reelection. And therein lies reason number two why I believe Kennedy will be the eventual nominee. The longer Biden stays in the race, the more he hurts the chances of undeclared Democratic contenders such as Vice President Kamala Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg or even former First Lady Michelle Obama.  As Biden lets other potential candidates twist in the wind, Kennedy continues to crisscross the nation taking almost every media opportunity given to him — even and especially those on the right, such as Fox News and the New York Post.  Of course, one of the reasons Kennedy is appearing on conservative outlets is because many in the now-activist mainstream media refuse to give him a platform.  Back in 1975 and 1976, when former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter ran his longshot campaign for the White House, some in the media also refused to give him a platform. But they did so because they ignorantly dismissed his campaign as a joke, not because they were personally or ideologically opposed to his policies.  Today, many in the media refuse to have Kennedy on because they are outraged that he dared to question the lockdowns, masking and vaccine mandates that came in the wake of the COVID-19 virus. Additionally, I believe many of them are simply running interference for the Biden White House.  But again, there is a real danger in viewing the political process with ideological blinders permanently attached to your face. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recently used a statement in a lawsuit over the Title 42 public health order to give a scathing overview of how civil liberties were trampled during the COVID era.  The U.S., he wrote, may “have experienced the greatest intrusions on civil liberties in the peacetime history of this country….Executive officials across the country issued emergency decrees on a breathtaking scale. Governors and local leaders imposed lockdown orders forcing people to remain in their homes. They shuttered businesses and schools, public and private. They closed churches even as they allowed casinos and other favored businesses to carry on. They threatened violators not just with civil penalties but with criminal sanctions too.”  Many on the left now condemning Kennedy as an “anti-vaxxer” might have no problem with these draconian actions. But guess what? Tens of millions of Americans did and still do.  These Americans are going to be very open to hearing Kennedy’s voice as he barnstorms the nation in the face of a liberal media blackout.  The next reason why I believe Kennedy will prevail is that he is far from the “one issue” candidate some in the media believe him to be. He is speaking to multiple issues a majority of voters want addressed — issues which have been upending their quality of life for years.  Kennedy’s “ace in the hole” may very well be his simplified campaign message: “Tell the truth.” He pledges to roll up his sleeves much like his dad did in the 1960s and engage in honest conversations with the people.  Next, because of the Kennedy name coupled with his own stated values, RFK Jr. will make tremendous inroads with Black, Hispanic and disenfranchised voters — a large part of the Democratic base.  After Kennedy met with the editorial board of the New York Post, the editors wrote: “Kennedy has real conviction and charisma, and he’s fiercely independent of many of the party’s reigning pieties — all of which should appeal.”  His message should most especially appeal considering the latest Monmouth University poll declaring that only 16 percent of respondents said the U.S. is headed in the right direction.  Sixteen percent.  The headline for that Post editorial read: “Biden’s a fool to ignore the RFK Jr. challenge.” To that list of “fools” I would add the activist media and the Democratic Party. Despise him all you want, but Kennedy is already polling at 20 percent against Biden as his pragmatic voice continues to reach more and more Americans in search of a champion.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  Many types of soft contact lenses available in the U.S. could contain toxic “forever chemicals,” new research has found.  All 18 sets of soft contacts evaluated in a recent consumer study came back with various levels of organic fluorine — an indicator for the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  The 18 sets, from three major brands, were sent to a laboratory certified by the Environmental Protection Agency by the Mamavation eco-wellness website, to determine just how much of this PFAS building block was present in each product.  “Your eyes are one of the most sensitive parts of your body,” Linda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health and the National Toxicology Program, said in a statement.  “Therefore, it’s concerning to see the presence of organic fluorine, which is likely a type of PFAS, found in all soft contact lens products tested,” Birnbaum added.  There are thousands of types of PFAS, many of which are common ingredients in household products such as nonstick pans, cosmetics and outdoor apparel.  While these compounds have been used for decades due to their water- and stain-resistant properties, PFAS are also linked to a variety of illnesses, such as kidney cancer, thyroid disease and testicular cancer.  The levels of organic fluorine uncovered by the lab ranged from 105 to 20,700 parts per million, according to the report, released by Mamavation with Environmental Health News — a site published by the nonprofit Environmental Health Sciences.  About 22 percent had more than 18,000 parts per million of this element, while 44 percent of the lenses had more than 4,000 parts per million of organic fluorine, per the report.  “The presumption that these organic fluorine levels measured in contact lenses are safe is laughable,” Pete Myers, chief scientist of Environmental Health Sciences, said in a statement.  Myers pointed out that the EPA last summer issued new drinking water health advisories for four types of PFAS, which ranged from 0.004 parts per trillion to 2,000 parts per trillion.  Acknowledging that “comparing drinking levels in water to concentrations in contact lenses is like comparing apples to oranges,” Myers noted that fluorine content in all of the lenses exceeded 100 parts per million.  Such concentrations, he continued, are “50,000 times higher than the highest level deemed safe in drinking water by the EPA.”  Research has yet to offer definitive proof as to whether PFAS exposure is linked to eye diseases and whether these persistent compounds can break down in the eye.  Nonetheless, the report stressed that because “the eye is one of the most sensitive areas of the human body,” there is reason to be concerned about contact lenses as a route for exposure.  Meanwhile, a 2020 study conducted in China showed that adults with higher blood levels of PFAS might have a higher incidence of certain types of ocular conditions.  “We know enough about PFAS chemicals to guess and fear that fluoropolymers in human cells or in the environment are anything but a pretty safety picture,” Terrence Collins, director of Carnegie Mellon University’s Institute for Green Sciences, said in a statement.  “I advise that such contact lenses be rigorously avoided,” Collins added. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nA recent consumer study found that all 18 sets of soft contact lenses evaluated contained various levels of organic fluorine, an indicator for the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). \nPFAS are linked to a variety of illnesses, such as kidney cancer, thyroid disease and testicular cancer. \nConcentrations of organic fluorine in the lenses were 50,000 times higher than the highest level deemed safe in drinking water by the EPA. \nThere is reason to be concerned about contact lenses as a route for exposure to PFAS.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses a recent consumer study which found that all 18 sets of soft contact lenses evaluated contained various levels of organic fluorine, an indicator for the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\nPFAS are linked to a variety of illnesses, and the levels of organic fluorine in the lenses exceeded 100 parts per million, which is 50,000 times higher than the highest level deemed safe in drinking water by the EPA.\nResearch has yet to offer definitive proof as to whether PFAS exposure is linked to eye diseases, but experts advise that such contact lenses be rigorously avoided."

        "text": "PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania — The Democratic machine is dead. Long live the new Democratic machine.  Two weeks ago, Allegheny County Democrats had their posterior handed to them in the May primary when three progressive Democrats, two with ties to the Democratic Socialists of America and the other backed by George Soros, ran the tables in the races for Allegheny County executive, district attorney, and the at-large county council seat.  A DEBT LIMIT WIN FOR THE GOP  State Rep. Sara Innamorato won the top job in the county, criminal defense attorney Matt Dugan won the race for district attorney, and Bethany Hallam kept her an at-large county council seat. Both Innamorato and Hallam had ties to the DSA when it began its takeover of the Democratic Party in 2018, while Dugan was flush with nearly $800,000 from the Soros PAC.  The wins come after a slow but strategic takeover by the far Left of the party that began in 2017 with a local magisterial race, gained steam in 2018, and rattled the establishment in 2022 when John Fetterman crushed Conor Lamb in the U.S. Senate primary.  By the time Innamorato, Hallam, and Dugan swept the county's top jobs this month, the fate of the 100-year-old Democratic Party powerhouse had collapsed.  One Democrat, who has been part of trying to hold together the Democratic traditional party for the past few years, said the effort was like \"trying to use masking tape to hold off a flood of molasses.\" \"The question is none of these Democrat candidates are appealing to the average Democrat, so do they hold their nose and vote for someone who doesn’t share their values, assimilate into the Republican Party, or just stay home?” he asked.  The Republican Party in Allegheny County has a candidate for county executive, businessman Joe Rockey, who will be running against Innamorato. Rockey is centrist, not caught up in the culture wars, and said he is laser-focused on the economy and jobs.  © Provided by Washington Examiner Summer Lee (right) and Sara Innamorato. (Photo courtesy of Summer Lee)  When asked by KDKA news reporter Jon Delano about his thoughts on former President Donald Trump, Rockey didn’t hesitate to say Trump was too divisive and that he didn’t support him.  “I am running to focus on the economy and jobs economic growth and jobs,” he said.  G. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Millersville University, said that while Allegheny County is solidly Democratic, the role of the county executive is that of someone who attracts businesses to the region and not someone who focuses on ideology.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  “For a Republican to be successful in that county, they have to separate themselves from candidates and positions like Rockey did,” he said. “That is the only way he could be politically viable. Is it a game-winner? I am not sure, but there is no doubt about it, it's smart politics to run as a good manager and not an ideologue,” Madonna said.  The matchup between Innamorato and Rockey will play out this fall — local Democrats not part of the new Left said there are already plans for civic and business leaders to back Rockey. If he is successful in running as a pragmatist, it may serve as a map for coalition building for the GOP that has been eroding in this county for over 20 years.

        "text": "“Why would I want to raise my kids in an environment in which they’re shamed for embracing diversity of thought and diverse cultures?” Jolly asked on MSNBC. Jolly, who quit the GOP in 2018, on Sunday said DeSantis’ attacks on migrants, the LGBTQ community and African Americans had left him feeling “unwelcome simply for my embrace of diversity of thought and as an ally” of those groups, even though he’s a “white, evangelical, straight male.” Florida-born and raised former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.) is thinking about leaving the Sunshine State because of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ (R) authoritarian policies. “I want my children to be exposed to as much diversity as possible and at home my wife and I can orient our family around the value set that’s right for us and prepare our kids to make decisions that are ultimately right for them as adults,” he continued. “That’s not permissible in the state of Florida. You’re shamed for it, you’re unwelcome.” “So yes, look, we consider every day whether to raise our kids in Florida. And I think it’s representative of thousands upon thousands of Floridians here in the Sunshine State,” Jolly added. Jolly’s comments echoed those he made to Time magazine, in which he lamented the shift in vibe that Florida has undergone underneath DeSantis’ governorship. “It’s in the air, it’s everywhere, it’s amazing,” he said of the proliferation of so-called culture wars in the state. “It’s between neighbors, it’s when you go to restaurants, when you go to schools. You’re on one side or the other, and people know it.” Last year, Jolly warned that DeSantis would as president be “far more dangerous” than Trump. “He’s more savvy. He’s more coy. And he doesn’t have the pitfalls that Donald Trump does,” Jolly said of DeSantis at the time, adding: “He’s really kneecapping democracy right now for people of Florida, and he will successfully do it on the national stage should he get to the White House.” DeSantis is imminently expected to join Trump in the 2024 race for the White House.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFormer Republican Congressman David Jolly from Florida is considering leaving the state due to Governor Ron DeSantis' authoritarian policies.\nJolly believes that DeSantis' attacks on migrants, the LGBTQ community, and African Americans have made him feel unwelcome for embracing diversity of thought.\nHe wants his children to be exposed to as much diversity as possible and is concerned that this is not permissible in the state of Florida.\nJolly has previously warned that DeSantis would be \"far more dangerous\" than Trump if he were to become president.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFormer Rep.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  How many white people must die due to racism before the media and Democratic presidents and politicians start discussing them? After the incidents of the last few weeks, it’s an important question that needs answers. And it’s a recurring omission that we should all be tired of happening at this point.  You’ve probably heard of Jordan Neely. He was the black man who died on May 1 in New York City after Daniel Penny, a former Marine, placed him in a chokehold after Neely harassed and threatened passengers. The case is under investigation, and people still do not know all the details of the incident, yet Neely was already considered a victim of racism. Outrage ensued, and somehow, almost instantly, protest signs were printed and distributed, and rallies were organized (including some by the New York Young Communist League — a political group that fuels many acts of these demonstrations of racial animosity and division).  BIDEN'S MISINFORMATION  Conversely, have you heard of Lundin Hathcock? How about James McDaniel? They were two people shot to death in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week. Have you heard of the killer, Carlton Gilford? I would guess that most people haven’t heard about any of them. But Gilford was the black man who shot both white people on April 18. Tulsa police charged him with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of shooting with intent to kill, and one count of malicious intimidation or harassment — Oklahoma’s version of a hate crime charge.  Two incidents of interracial homicide, a couple of weeks apart, and only one of them received widespread media attention and scrutiny. Only Neely’s death made most newspapers and the talk show circuit. The legacy media purposely cover up hate crimes committed by black people because it doesn’t fit the cultural and political left-wing agenda.  Furthermore, as people have tried to shape Neely’s death as a hate crime, Hathcock and McDaniel’s deaths were actual hate crimes. Yet those who parade around pretending to be outraged about racism do not care when the victims are white. Where is the outrage when black men commit racist killings against white people?  Democratic presidents, politicians, pundits, professors, teachers, and legacy media don’t even remotely care about white victims of hate crimes. They routinely engage in despicable omissions to advance radical, agenda-driven narratives to perpetuate myths about a systemic racist and white supremacist society. They claim to care about ending racism but are only concerned when the victims are nonwhite people. And many times, they even falsely insert racism into incidents in which there originally wasn’t any.  People must become vigilant in exposing the Left’s indoctrination and brainwashing campaign on racism and hate crimes. It is an utter disgrace, though unsurprising, that Gilford didn’t receive as much attention as Neely. It is an incident that affects everyone. It isn’t a white or black thing or a Republican or Democratic thing. We should strive to end all hate crimes and racism, not just those the Left can use for political propaganda. Every victim of hate crime matters, regardless of skin color.

        "text": "No survivors were found at the crash site of a plane whose pilot was unresponsive as it flew near the Washington, DC, area Sunday, prompting military fighter jets to attempt to intercept the aircraft before it ultimately crashed, authorities say. First responders reached the site Sunday evening, about four hours after state and local authorities launched a ground and air search for the crashed aircraft, Virginia State Police said. State police said they have suspended their search and will identify the plane’s passengers when the information becomes available. US F-16 fighter jets caused a sonic boom across the Washington, DC, region Sunday as they scrambled to reach the unresponsive aircraft, officials said. A US official said the F-16s did not shoot down the aircraft and that it is typical for the Federal Aviation Administration to call in jets if someone is flying unsafely. The pilot of the civilian aircraft was unresponsive as the F-16 fighter jets attempted to make contact, according to a news release from the Continental US North American Aerospace Defense Command Region. The F-16 jets were “authorized to travel at supersonic speeds,” which resulted in the sonic boom heard in the Washington, DC, area. The F-16s used flares “in an attempt to draw attention from the pilot,” the release added. The civilian aircraft, a Cessna 560 Citation V, was intercepted by the NORAD jets around 3:20 p.m. and ultimately crashed near the George Washington National Forest in Virginia. “The pilot was unresponsive and the Cessna subsequently crashed near the George Washington National Forest, Virginia,” the release said. “NORAD attempted to establish contact with the pilot until the aircraft crashed.” Four people were on board the aircraft, which overshot its planned destination by 315 miles before crashing, sources familiar with the investigation said. Search efforts were still underway by state and local authorities Sunday evening, Virginia State Police told CNN. State police were notified around 3:50 p.m. of a possible aircraft crash in the Staunton/Blue Ridge Parkway region, the agency said. The National Transportation Safety Board said on Twitter it was investigating the crash. The agency said it will arrive at the scene Monday and will begin “the process of documenting the scene and examining the aircraft.” Private jet registered to Florida company The private jet that crashed was registered to Encore Motors of Melbourne, Inc., out of Florida, according to FAA records. Barbara Rumpel is the president of the company. When reached by phone Sunday, her husband, John Rumpel, told CNN Barbara was safe and that they are owners of Encore. They did not want to comment further to CNN. On her Facebook profile, Barbara commented on an unrelated post of others asking if she was on the plane and sending prayers, writing, “My family is gone, my daughter and granddaughter.” John Rumpel told the Washington Post his family members, including his daughter, a grandchild and her nanny, were on board. He told The New York Times the family was returning home to East Hampton, New York, after a four-day trip to his home in North Carolina, and added his granddaughter is 2 years old. The plane and those aboard have not been found. Sonic boom heard across region The military aircraft caused a sonic boom heard across the Washington, DC, metropolitan region. “We are aware of reports from communities throughout the National Capital Region of a loud ‘boom’ this afternoon,” DC Homeland Security & Emergency Management said on Twitter. There is no threat at this time, the agency added. Earlier, the FAA said in a statement that a Cessna Citation crashed in southwest Virginia Sunday. The aircraft took off from Elizabethton Municipal Airport in Elizabethton, Tennessee, and was bound for Long Island MacArthur Airport in New York. The aircraft crashed into a mountainous terrain in a “sparsely populated area”, according to FAA. Capitol Hill briefly went on ‘elevated alert’ The US Capitol Complex was placed on “an elevated alert” when the small aircraft flew near the area on Sunday afternoon, according to a statement from US Capitol Police. “This afternoon, our officials were working closely with our federal partners to monitor an unresponsive pilot who was flying an airplane near the National Capital Region. The U.S. Capitol Complex was briefly placed on an elevated alert until the airplane left the area,” the statement said. The US Secret Service said they did not alter their posture for keeping President Joe Biden secure after the incident. Biden was golfing at the Andrews Air Force Base golf course near Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. The incident “had no impact on Secret Service,” spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a Sunday statement. The President has been briefed on the incident, according to a White House official. CNN’s Philip Wang, Raja Razek, Joe Sutton, Rashard Rose, Aaron Pellish, Amanda Jackson and Sam Fossum contributed to this report.

        "text": "It was roughly nine months ago when Rep. Jim Jordan’s began his offensive against federal law enforcement in earnest. The Ohio Republican claimed last August that he had secret sources inside the FBI, who, as luck would have it, privately assured the far-right congressman that his conspiracy theories have merit. I have tried to keep an open mind about this, but Jordan hasn’t exactly made it easy. In November, the GOP lawmaker released a report on the FBI’s alleged “politicization,” which was so pitiful that it quickly became the subject of ridicule. Republican leaders nevertheless rewarded Jordan for his failure, making him the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and putting him in charge of a new panel with a specific purpose: finding evidence of the government being “weaponized” against conservatives. As regular readers know, the panel’s first big anti-FBI hearing was an embarrassing display, and it was soon followed by revelations that the FBI “whistleblowers” the Ohio Republican has been touting for months weren’t actually whistleblowers, and their recent behind-the-scenes testimony was literally unbelievable. As a Washington Post report noted, yesterday’s hearing was no better. If the proceedings were intended to embarrass the bureau, they backfired, painting the FBI’s accusers and their allies in an unflattering light. Jordan hid transcripts from committee members, downplayed the fact that some of his witnesses have been paid by a member of Donald Trump’s team, and pretended his so-called “whistleblowers” don’t have serious credibility problems. What we were left with was a congressional hearing about a few FBI agents who don’t like the fact that they were punished for alleged misconduct. As former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger joked soon after, the hearing was little more than “a public airing of an HR complaint.” Jordan and his conspiratorial panel have confronted criticisms in recent months from disappointed GOP insiders, Republican-aligned media, and influential leaders from the conservative movement, each of whom expected the Ohioan to deliver real results. He’s failing spectacularly. A Politico report last month quoted a GOP aide who conceded that on Capitol Hill, Republicans agree that Jordan’s “weaponization” panel was off to a “rocky start.” That reputation did not improve yesterday. But let’s not miss the forest for the trees: Jordan isn’t just humiliating himself, he’s also inadvertently proving the opposite of his intended point. The Republican and his team have spent nine months desperately trying to find evidence of the FBI becoming corrupted and politicized. What he’s proven, however, is that he hasn’t found anything meaningful, despite his best efforts, reinforcing suspicions that there just isn’t evidence to find. By trying and failing to make a case against the bureau, Jordan is effectively giving the FBI a clean bill of political health.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nRep.

This comes days after Title 42's end.  The Texas governor vowed to continue sending buses of immigrants to sanctuary cities across the country until President Joe Biden and his administration act on the concerns at the southern border.  TIM SCOTT PICKS UP FIRST SENATE ENDORSEMENT AHEAD OF WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCEMENT  \"Texas' overwhelmed and overrun border communities should not have to shoulder the flood of illegal immigration due to President Biden's reckless open border policies, like his mass catch and release without court dates or any way to track them,\" Abbott said.  \"Until the President and his Administration step up and fulfill their constitutional duty to secure the border, the State of Texas will continue busing migrants to self-declared sanctuary cities like Denver to provide much-needed relief to our small border towns,\" he added.  The immigrants were dropped off in Denver near Civic Center Park at the corner of 14th Street and Court Place, per the announcement.  A report indicated that 41 immigrants were transported on the bus.  According to the governor's office, \"more than 19,000\" immigrants have been bused to sanctuary cities since April 2022.  Title 42, before its end, was a pandemic-era measure that allowed Border Patrol to expel immigrants without issuing asylum hearing dates due to concerns over communicable diseases.  Before the policy's end at 11:59 pm on May 11, a bus of immigrants from Texas arrived at Vice President Kamala Harris's residence in Washington, D.C.  In November, the Lone Star State marked the 300th bus of immigrants being sent from Texas. The bus was headed to Chicago, Illinois, which also considers itself a sanctuary for illegal immigration.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  Last month, former Democratic Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot pleaded with Abbott to stop sending buses as the city lacks the resources to deal with the influx of immigrants. \"We simply have no more shelters, spaces, or resources to accommodate an increase of individuals at this level, with little coordination or care, that does not pose a risk to them or others,\" she wrote.

        "text": "© Provided by LGBTQNation The bars were branded \"he/him\" and \"she/her,\" with and without nuts. The culture wars reached a small community college in Madera, California recently, when a gay professor got political and handed out gendered – and transphobic – chocolate bars. He was put on leave for his “neo-pronouns” protest. David Richardson, a tenured history professor at Madera Community College, brought the chocolate bars to a campus open house on April 29. They were branded “he/him” and “she/her,” with and without nuts. Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you. The gag might have played better for a class of fourth graders or aging Mad Magazine fans. “I’m being investigated for, ‘creating a hostile work environment based on gender,’” said Richardson, who lost his sense of humor soon after he was handed a notice of administrative leave by a uniformed police officer at the school. The teacher told Fox News: “I feel as if they’ve been sort of looking for a reason to get rid of me because I don’t share the current opinion on neo-pronouns and that kind of stuff.” “Everything we do now is geared towards this ideology, and diversity of viewpoint is being eliminated.” The conservative confectionery is the creation of Jeremy Boreing, co-CEO of far-right news site The Daily Wire. Boreing created his Jeremy’s Chocolate in reaction to chocolate king Hershey’s running a trans-supportive ad campaign for International Women’s Day in March. Richardson claims he’s been locked out of his university email and barred from campus, with no communication from the school following his paper suspension. The history prof likened his treatment to the Hollywood Ten and other victims of the Red Scare in the 1940s and 50s, when Communist panic overtook the country, and demagogues like Sen.

        "text": "© Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 21: Young tourists shout their opposition to anti-abortion activists from the plaza in front of the U.S. Supreme Court as demonstrators pray in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on April 21, 2023 in Washington, DC. Organized by The Stanton Public Policy Center/Purple Sash Revolution, the small group of demonstrators called on the Supreme Court to affirm Federal District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling that suspends the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.  Winston Churchill issued a famous warning in his 1945 election broadcast. The great statesman was rightly worried about the threat posed by the Soviet Union, and the tyrannical impulses of communism. Churchill was clear: \"Socialism is, in its essence, an attack upon the right of the ordinary man or woman to breathe freely without having a harsh, clumsy tyrannical hand clapped across their mouths and nostrils.... I declare to you from the bottom of my heart that no socialist system can be established without a political police.\"  Seventy-five years later, Churchill's warnings remain prescient. Millions of Americans find themselves shocked and appalled by the weaponization of the federal government to crush legitimate political dissent. Specifically, the use of the FBI by the Department of Justice against parents, Christians, and pro-life advocates grows more intense by the day.  Just last month FBI agents Ashley Roberts and Kathleen Brown showed up at the childhood home of pro-life advocate Elise Ketch.  Unaware of having done anything to warrant the unsettling appearance of federal agents on her mother's doorstep, Ketch expressed concerns that the goal of the FBI's visit was to intimidate her and her team. Judging by recent FBI mistreatment of pro-life advocates and people of faith throughout the past year, Ketch is likely right.  The FBI has heightened its use of aggressive tactics against pro-life Americans since the Biden administration's promise to use every tool available to protect the right of women to subvert pro-life state laws passed in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson decision. This now includes heavy-handed unequal enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act against pro-life advocates.  Recall that the FBI last year sent more than a dozen agents to arrest pro-life advocate Mark Houck at gunpoint in front of his wife and children. They carted Houck off in handcuffs and a \"belly chain\" as if he were a violent criminal, and then forced him to endure a lengthy, humiliating public trial with the threat of an 11-year prison sentence looming over his head.  The case against Houck was so flimsy that the Philadelphia district attorney declined to file any charges, and courts additionally threw out a civil lawsuit against Houck filed by the clinic escort. Yet the FBI proceeded anyway. Houck was ultimately exonerated of all charges, though why he was singled out, and why the Department of Justice chose to go to trial, remains a mystery.  The heavy hand of federal police power has gone missing when it comes to violence against Catholic churches and pro-life care centers. Since 2020, more than 300 incidents of vandalism, arson, and destruction of Catholic churches have been recorded. There have also been almost 90 incidents of fire bombings, vandalism, and other attacks on pro-life organizations that offer free resources, support, and care to women and children in need. The Department of Justice has taken little to no action to stem this ongoing violence, yet decided to indict at least 11 pro-life advocates under the FACE Act—a law that protects abortion clinics as well as churches and pro-life pregnancy centers.  Such blatant terrorization of pro-life Americans and devoted Catholics should garner national outcry, or at least merit action from the government agencies tasked with protecting Americans from acts of domestic terrorism and hate. Unfortunately, while quick to pounce on any semblance of pro-life activism, our highest law enforcement agencies have been missing in action in defending those who disagree with the extreme abortion policy now advanced by the current administration.  This pattern of selectively enforcing the law against political opponents sends a clear message to all Americans: if you aim to advance a position at odds with the agenda of this White House, you may constitute a \"threat to democracy.\" And you may soon get a knock on your door from the FBI.  Meanwhile, workers at pro-life maternity homes and pregnancy resource centers around the country are forced to scrape together funds to repair windows and doors, while fearing for their safety as threatening blood-red messages warn them that \"if abortions aren't safe then neither are you.\" Catholic priests will continue to say mass while the decapitated saint statues just outside the church eerily remind them that vandals and violence lurk.  Regardless of their political views, all Americans should be outraged and deeply concerned to see such blatant weaponization of our government agencies, including the FBI's intimidation of political dissenters. No government is immune to totalitarian impulses when power goes unchecked. Without vigilance, history indeed is vulnerable to repeating itself.  Brian Burch is president of Catholic Vote.

        "text": "© Stewart F. House, Getty Images Roberto Marquez is pictured constructing a wooden cross memorial at the scene of a mass shooting a day earlier at Allen Premium Outlets in Allen, Texas.  ALLEN, Texas − Authorities are looking into whether the gunman who killed eight people at a suburban Dallas outdoor mall showed an interest in white supremacist and neo-Nazi views, and if those provided a motive for the weekend attack, The Associated Press and CNN reported Sunday.  While cautioning that the investigation has just begun, law enforcement sources told the outlets that Mauricio Garcia, identified as the gunman, had links to that ideology. Those included social media accounts and posts as well as a patch on his chest that read “RWDS,” an acronym for the phrase “Right Wing Death Squad,” which is popular among right-wing extremists and white supremacy groups.  Garcia, 33, was killed by police responding to Saturday's assault, which left seven people with injuries that required hospitalization.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  In addition to reviewing Garcia's electronic media presence, federal agents have interviewed family members and associates of Garcia to ask about his ideological beliefs and are reviewing his financial records said an official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.  Authorities were picking through shattered glass and shell casings Sunday at the mall in Allen, a city of 105,000 residents about 25 miles north of Dallas. Amid the chaos as hundreds of shoppers at Allen Premium Outlets scrambled for cover Saturday, a police officer on an unrelated call heard the gunshots and raced to the scene, Allen Police Chief Brian Harvey said.  \"He heard gunshots, located the gunshots, located the shooter, neutralized the shooter, neutralized the threat,\" Harvey said at a briefing late Saturday.  Three law enforcement officials who requested anonymity to discuss details of an ongoing investigation identified the shooter as Garcia, AP reported. One of the officials said Garcia had been staying at a nearby motel. The official said investigators have been searching the motel and a home in the Dallas area connected to the suspect.  Authorities have not released information on a possible motive or details about the victims, including their names.  President Joe Biden tweeted Sunday that the assailant wore tactical gear and was armed with an AR-15-style rifle. He thanked first responders who acted \"quickly and courageously\" but said such attacks had become shockingly familiar.  \"Once again, Congress must send me a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,\" Biden wrote. \"Enacting universal background checks. Requiring safe storage. Ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe.\"  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott dismissed gun control legislation as a \"quick solution\" that won't solve the problem, telling \"Fox News Sunday\" that addressing mental health issues is the long-term solution.  Six victims and the gunman died at the scene, Allen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd said. Nine people were transported to regional hospitals, where two died a short time later, police said. Three people remained hospitalized in critical condition Sunday and four were in fair condition.  Developments:  ∙ Harvey said he believed the shooter acted alone and asked that anyone who witnessed the attacks or had video from the scene contact police.  ∙ Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas described the shooting as \"another horrific tragedy in our country.\" Mayorkas, speaking on \"Face the Nation,\" said he spoke with the governor and mayor and that state and local authorities were leading the investigation.  ∙ Biden ordered flags flown at half-staff until May 11.  Steven Spainhouer said he raced to the scene after his son called from the mall to say shots were being fired. Spainhouer told CBS News he arrived before any first responders, and while a handful of people around him were recording videos, he tried to save lives. Some were so badly hurt they had to be loaded into police cars because ambulances would not have arrived fast enough.  \"I was on the phone with 911 and I was telling them we have a mass casualty incident,\" he said. \"The first girl I walked up to was crouched down covering her head in the bushes, so I felt for a pulse, pulled her head to the side and she had no face.\"  Katie Shi, who lives with her husband and two children in Allen about a mile away from the scene, said the outdoor outlet mall is a frequent go-to place for her family. They had just purchased a pair of shoes for her 7-year-old son at the Nike outlet, she said Sunday.  On Saturday afternoon, Shi, 39, had been out running errands when she passed the mall on the way home and noticed the heavy police presence. By the time she got home to her relieved husband, the shooting was all over the news and there were helicopters in the skies overhead. While Shi and her family are safe, it’s still scary, she said, not to know whether any of her children’s classmates may have been affected.  \"Having it happen in your hometown, where you go to church, where your kids go to school, where you do your shopping – it takes your sense of safety away,\" she said.  Shi says she knows the gun issue can be polarizing, but she finds it bewildering that after so many mass shootings in the U.S., \"life just keeps going and we don’t pause to say, 'Let’s do something.' No one needs to have semi-automatic weapons.\"  The attack continues a troubling trend of mass shootings across the nation and in Texas. It comes a week after a gunman opened fire on neighbors in Cleveland, Texas, killing five people including a 9-year-old boy. Last May, a gunman in Uvalde, Texas, shot his grandmother before driving to an elementary and opening fire, killing 19 students and two teachers before being killed by police.  James Alan Fox, a professor of Criminology, Law, and Public Policy at Northeastern University who has studied mass killings for 40 years, says 2023 has been the worst year in terms of mass killings \"since at least 2006 and probably ever.\"  \"I've not seen anything like this,\" Fox said. \"We have more guns in the hands of Americans. Gun sales have skyrocketed since COVID. There's a lot of divisiveness in this country, and people suffering emotionally and economically since the pandemic.\"  The shooting brought the customary statements of sympathy and support from federal, state, and local officials. Mayor Ken Fulk issued a statement promising full support to families of the victims. He said Allen is a \"proud and safe city,\" making the attack more shocking.  \"We are a strong and caring community,\" Fulk said. \"We want all of the victims and their families impacted by this tragedy to know that we will wrap our arms around you, and we are here for you.\"  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, said he and wife Heidi were \"praying for the victims.\" Abbott, who like Cruz has consistently supported easing gun restrictions, pledged to ensure \"all needed assistance and resources\" would be swiftly deployed.  “Our hearts are with the people of Allen, Texas tonight during this unspeakable tragedy,” Abbott said in a statement.  Rep. Keith Self, a Republican who represents the congressional district where Allen is located, tweeted a statement Saturday offering prayers to the victims, their families and law enforcement. Told later in a CNN interview that many believe prayers aren't working, Self responded:  \"Well, those are people that don't believe in an almighty God who has, who is absolutely in control of our lives. I'm a Christian. I believe that he is.''  Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat who represents Uvalde, took aim on social media at lawmakers who resist gun reform.  \"There is a special place in hell for people who watch all this happen and choose to do nothing. #bloodontheirhands,\" he tweeted.  Police and witnesses said a gunman parked a gray Honda Accord outside the mall at around 3:30 p.m. Saturday. The man began shooting people walking on sidewalks outside the mall, a popular shopping spot with many upscale outlets such as Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein and Ann Taylor.  Dashcam video circulating online showed the gunman getting out of a car and starting to shoot. More than three dozen shots could be heard as the vehicle recording the video drove away.  Pretzel stand employee Maxwell Gum, 16, described a stampede of shoppers as he and others sheltered in a storage room.  \"We started running. Kids were getting trampled,\" Gum said. \"My co-worker picked up a 4-year-old girl and gave her to her parents.\"  Fontayne Payton, 35, was at H&M when he heard gunshots through his headphones. People in the store ushered a group into the fitting rooms and then a lockable back room, he said. When they were given the all-clear to leave, Payton saw the store had broken windows and a trail of blood to the door. Outside, Payton saw bodies.  \"I pray it wasn’t kids, but it looked like kids,\" he said. \"It broke me when I walked out to see that.\"  Witnesses told WFAA-TV the shooter was dressed in all black. They said the shooting took place near Fatburger restaurant and in front of the H&M outlet. H&M issued a statement saying all its employees were safe and that counseling will be provided to any who request it.  Max Weiss, 18, told CNN he was working in the mall when he heard gunshots for as long as three minutes. He said he and other employees and customers locked the front door to the store and huddled in the stock room. He described the scene as “anxious, tense and terrifying\" and said the group waited nearly two hours for officers to come into the store and escort them out of the parking lot area with their arms in the air.  Mass killings are happening with staggering frequency in the United States this year: an average of about one a week, according to an analysis of The Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University mass killing database. So far there have been 22 mass killings in the U.S. in 2023.  The Gun Violence Archive says the Texas mass shooting is the 200th in the nation this year and the 12th in May. Mass shootings, defined as four or more people shot, differ from mass killings, defined as four or more people killed.

The Kremlin's accusation, made without providing evidence, was the latest in a string of reported incidents far from the war's front lines. Kyiv said it had nothing to do with the alleged incident and suggested it could be used as a pretext for a new Russian attack inside Ukraine. The United States had no advance notice if there was a drone attack against the Kremlin by Ukraine, two U.S. officials told NBC News. The officials expressed skepticism that a drone could get that close to the Kremlin given the fact that Russia has so many air defense systems protecting it. An attack on the heart of Moscow, even if foiled, would represent a dramatic illustration of Russian vulnerability ahead of an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive that will seek to push the Kremlinâ€™s forces out of of occupied land. Russian military and special services had disabled two attacking drones, sending debris crashing onto the grounds of the seat of government, the Kremlin said in a statement on its website. It blamed the alleged attack on Ukraine but said that no one was hurt. \"We view these actions as a planned terrorist attack and an assassination attempt targeting the President, carried out ahead of Victory Day,\" the statement said, referring to the May 9 celebration of the Soviet Unionâ€™s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. \"Russia reserves the right to take countermeasures wherever and whenever it deems appropriate,\" it added. Â© Provided by NBC News Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia. (Mikhail Klimentyev / AP) Videos that show an object exploding over the Kremlin on Wednesday, the building's roof on fire and smoke rising from the area circulated widely on social media. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, denied Ukrainian involvement and suggested that \"guerilla activities of local resistance forces\" could be to blame. He said the news was a sign that Russia is preparing â€œa large-scale terrorist attackâ€ of its own. Zelenskyyâ€™s press officer, Serhiy Nikiforov, said in a comment to local media that Kyiv had no information about â€œthe so-called night attacks on the Kremlin,â€ repeating its stated focus on its own territory. â€œUkraine directs all available forces and means to liberate its own territories, not to attack foreign ones.â€ Following the news, Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyyâ€™s chief of staff, posted three fire emojis on his Telegram channel without any commentary, but deleted the post shortly after. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state news agency RIA Novosti that Putin was not in the Kremlin at the time of the alleged attack, and was working out of a presidential residence near Moscow. The Kremlin said the presidentâ€™s schedule was unaffected by the incident. Peskov added that plans to hold the Victory Day parade in Red Square remain in place, according to the agency. Some military analysts questioned whether the alleged incident could be seen as an assassination attempt. \"This looks like #Ukraine (assuming it was Ukraine) is trying to bring the war home to #Russia, by hitting symbolic targets,\" said Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst, and head of intelligence at Le Beck consultancy, in a tweet. Russia has frequently accused Ukraine of planning attacks inside the country, often met with official denials. The U.S. officials were skeptical that any drone Washington might have provided to Ukraine would have been used in the alleged attack on Wednesday because it would have had to fly very far from Ukraine all the way to the Kremlin. Neither official could say whether the report could be a disinformation campaign by Russia or not, adding that they were still trying to figure that out. â€œI would take anything coming out of the Kremlin with a very large shaker of salt,â€ Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a world press freedom event Wednesday. Ukrainian agents have pursued drone attacks inside Russia, contrary to U.S. and Western wishes, according to a batch of leaked U.S. intel documents. The alleged incident comes 14 months into Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine and ahead of an expected counteroffensive by Kyiv's military. Russian forces have struggled to make substantive progress in their own push over the winter, a campaign focused around a brutal battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut that seems to have come at a steep cost for both sides. After domestic blowback to the call-up of hundreds of thousands of military reservists last year, the Kremlin has recently stepped up its efforts to recruit volunteers to fight in Ukraine with slick advertising campaigns and new legislation. But it has also increasingly seen the war brought home in a wave of recent incidents inside the country as both sides seemingly launch drone attacks ahead of the crucial fighting to come. A large fire was blazing earlier Wednesday at a fuel depot near a key bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea. Authorities blamed the incident on a drone attack, days after another caused a fire at a nearby oil terminal and blasts derailed freight trains in a region bordering Ukraine. Russiaâ€™s FSB meanwhile arrested seven people it said were connected with Ukrainian intelligence and planning â€œa series of high-profile sabotage and terrorist actsâ€ in the annexed peninsula. Russian war hawks also weighed in after the alleged drone attack on the Kremlin, speculating about potential escalation from Moscow in response. â€œMaybe it will kick off for real now?â€ Margarita Simonyan, head of the Russian state broadcaster RT, posted on Telegram. Simonyan is one of the most vocal pro-war public figures in the country. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Russian parliamentâ€™s lower house, demanded \"the use of weapons capable of stopping and destroying the Kyiv terrorist regime,\" in a Telegram post. Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russiaâ€™s Wagner Group whose mercenary forces have led the assault on Bakhmut, said the Ukrainian counteroffensive had already begun. â€œThe enemy has also become more active outside the historical borders of Ukraine â€” the Russian Federation,â€ Prigozhin said in a statement. â€œWe see the situation in our various areas: trains, drones, and so on. Therefore, I think that everything has already gone. When will it become active? I think that in the near future, maybe days,â€ he added.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe Kremlin has accused Ukraine of attempting to assassinate President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack on the Kremlin, an accusation that has been denied by Kyiv and met with demands for retaliation from Moscow.\nThe United States had no advance notice of the alleged attack, and the Kremlin said no one was hurt.\nUkrainian officials have denied any involvement and suggested that local resistance forces could be to blame.\nThe incident comes ahead of an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces in occupied land.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nRussia has accused Ukraine of attempting to assassinate President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack on the Kremlin. \nThe US had no advance notice of the alleged attack and expressed skepticism that a drone could get that close to the Kremlin. \nVideos of an object exploding over the Kremlin, the building's roof on fire and smoke rising from the area circulated widely on social media. \nRussia has accused Ukraine of planning attacks inside the country, often met with official denials."

Liz Cheney on Sunday called on graduates to engage in politics and urged them not to waver from the truth, invoking her experience battling against former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.  The former Wyoming congresswoman lambasted her former GOP colleagues during a commencement speech at Colorado College, her alma mater.  “After the 2020 election and the attack of January 6th, my fellow Republicans wanted me to lie. They wanted me to say the 2020 election was stolen, the attack of January 6th wasn’t a big deal, and Donald Trump wasn’t dangerous,” Cheney said. “I had to choose between lying and losing my position in House leadership.”  “No party, no nation, no people can defend and perpetuate a constitutional republic if they accept leaders who have gone to war with the rule of law, with the democratic process, with the peaceful transfer of power, with the Constitution itself,” Cheney added.  The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, she was a member of House Republican leadership until her continued opposition to Trump's actions — and her vote to impeach him — led her colleagues to oust her from leadership. Cheney was the ranking Republican on the high-profile Jan. 6 committee investigating the riot at the Capitol, a position that in part cost her reelection in 2022.  Since her departure from Congress, Cheney has unabashedly called out the events surrounding Jan. 6 and been unrelenting in her criticism of the former president. Though she called Trump out by name Sunday, Cheney did not say anything of his 2024 campaign. But she did repeatedly attack her own party, and warned of efforts by some political operatives to suppress votes in upcoming elections.  “Cleta Mitchell, a political operative and an election denier, told a gathering of Republicans recently that it’s crucially important that they make sure that college students don’t vote,” Cheney said. “Those who are trying to unravel the foundations of our republic, who are threatening the rule of law and the sanctity of elections know they cannot succeed if you vote. So, Class of 2023, get out and vote.”  Cheney also urged the graduates — particularly the women — to consider running for office.  “This country needs more of you in office.

Ron DeSantis (R-FL) readies his impending presidential run, he’s built a brand largely off of former president Donald Trump’s: appearing “tough on crime” and making noise about election security.  Florida’s Office of Election Crimes and Security (OECS) is at the nexus of those issues. Launched last year, DeSantis has said the new police force will investigate fraud allegations throughout the state in order to find violations of election law. But state Democrats and activists alike see it as a political stunt designed to be “splattered across front pages,” as DeSantis tries to court Trump supporters and Big Lie believers ahead of his expected 2024 run.  While he claims the task force was created to root out voter fraud, the governor himself has boasted about Florida’s robust election security in the past. “What we do in Florida is, there’s a pre- and post-election audit that happens automatically,” he said back in 2021. “So, that has happened. It passed with flying colors in terms of how that’s going.”  DeSantis doesn’t seem to have lied about that: The OECS only net 20 arrests last year. The governor made a big show of announcing the 20 supposedly illegal votes but his administration has not unearthed any sort of election malfeasance on a grand enough scale to justify its multi-million dollar budget.  A recent lawsuit, however, highlighted what the state has accomplished with the program: letting former felons vote and sending them to jail.  Last week, the League of Women Voters of Florida filed a lawsuit against Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd (R) alleging that the state has enacted a “byzantine” voter registration system that fails to comply with federal rules.  Florida’s voter registration applications, the group argues, don’t adequately clarify eligibility requirements for formerly incarcerated citizens, even though they’ve changed substantially in recent years. “It increases the risk that a returning citizen will be investigated, prosecuted, and re-ensnared in the criminal system,” the complaint said.  Their evidence? It’s already happened.  Since Florida passed a ballot measure seeking to reinstate suffrage for about 1.4 million formerly incarcerated residents, state Republicans have rolled back its reach.  On June 28, 2019, DeSantis signed a bill (SB 7066) limiting the reinstatement to those who’ve completed the full terms of their sentences, like getting off probation or paying court-ordered fees, which was soon challenged in court.  An appellate court eventually ruled in DeSantis’ favor, but acknowledged complaints that “it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the facts that determine eligibility to vote” before batting them down for being too vague.  Those complaints would be realized over the next few years. Last August, for example, DeSantis held a campaign-style press conference to announce the OECS’ first 20 arrests. But it became clear that the arrestees didn’t even know they’d committed a crime.  “The state promised that it would treat registrations like requests for eligibility determinations—which, by the way, is required by federal law,” Blair Bowie, who oversees the Campaign Legal Center’s Restore Your Vote project, told TPM. “Instead, they shifted the full burden of responsibility for making eligibility determinations to the potential registrants. And what’s worse, they didn’t provide any useful information to the registrants to allow them to determine if they were eligible.”  Hillsborough, Florida resident Nathan Hart was among them. He told TPM that he’d registered on a whim in March 2020, when a man flagged him down outside his local DMV encouraging him to apply.  “I told him, I wasn’t sure because it was a first degree felony that I had,” he said. “And he goes, ‘well, the best way to find out if you’re approved or not is to just go ahead and register to vote. And if you’re approved, you’ll be good.’”  The Florida State Department was quick to reject this assumption to TPM. When asked about the state’s responsibility to alert registrants of their eligibility status, department spokesman Mark Ard highlighted a statute saying that when a resident submits a voter registration application, they’re swearing that they are eligible to vote.  But Cecile Scoon, president of the voting rights group who brought the lawsuit, argued that Ard was “completely ignoring the law.” She pointed out that the Division of Elections, the office within the State Department tasked with overseeing eligibility statuses, accepted the responsibility during legal proceedings for Amendment 4.  Rep. Laurel Lee, Florida’s former secretary of state and current House Republican, also put that interpretation in writing. “The Florida Department of State has a duty under section 98.075(5), Fla. Stat. to identify those registered voters who have been convicted of a felony and whose voting rights have not been restored,” she told ProPublica and Times/Herald back in 2020. “The law requires the department to review information from a number of sources and make an initial determination as to whether information is credible and reliable.”  But Division of Elections Director Maria Matthews testified back in 2020 that they had a backlog of 85,000 applications that were flagged for voter registration eligibility—and only 20 staffers at the time to go through them.  Officers from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office showed up to Hart’s doorstep three years later to arrest him for a crime that took five minutes to commit. “I was just flabbergasted,” he said. “I had no idea what they were there for.”  When voting rights groups challenged SB 7066 in court, election officials in the state “swore up and down” that they would assume the responsibility to ensure that new voter registrants were eligible under the new rules, Bowie said.  “Fast forward three years later, we learn that Florida election officials did not do what they swore under oath they would—they did not ensure that everyone who registered was eligible to vote,” she told TPM. “Instead, they let them register and cast ballots—and then turned around and prosecuted them.”  Hart, a former DeSantis supporter himself, agrees. “It’s painfully obvious to everyone who’s not an extreme supporter of the governor that this is some political maneuver to make him look good to his constituents a few months before the election happened,” he said.  Once he reached the courtroom – his was so far the only case of those arrested to actually make it to trial and it ended in a partial acquittal – statewide prosecutors argued that he had voted illegally on purpose, he told TPM. “They accused me of just inventing this guy out of whole cloth,” he said. “And that I’d checked off the boxes that my rights were restored when in actuality they hadn’t been.”  But Hart maintains that he didn’t realize that he was ineligible. “I’m not exactly a Florida constitutional lawyer,” he said, “so I would have no way of knowing that.”<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has created a police force to investigate voter fraud allegations in the state, but it has not uncovered any large-scale malfeasance.\nThe League of Women Voters of Florida has filed a lawsuit against the state alleging that its voter registration system fails to comply with federal rules.\nSince Florida passed a ballot measure to reinstate suffrage for formerly incarcerated residents, state Republicans have rolled back its reach.\nThe OECS has arrested people for voting illegally, but many of them were unaware that they were ineligible.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nGov.\nRon DeSantis (R-FL) has created a police force to investigate voter fraud in Florida, but the program has not uncovered any large-scale malfeasance.\nInstead, it has been used to target formerly incarcerated citizens who were unaware of their ineligibility to vote.\nActivists and Democrats have accused DeSantis of using the program as a political stunt to court Trump supporters and Big Lie believers ahead of his expected 2024 presidential run.\nThe League of Women Voters of Florida has filed a lawsuit against the state for its \"byzantine\" voter registration system that fails to comply with federal rules."

        "text": "© Provided by Hollywood Unlocked Florida Teacher Under Investigation After Showing The Disney Movie 'Strange World' In Class  A Florida teacher is under investigation by the state Department of Education after showing the Disney movie “Strange World” in her classroom. Fifth-grade teacher Jenna Barbee, is currently making headlines because the movie she showed her students is the first Disney movie with an out, gay character.  Barbee, a teacher at Winding Waters K-8, said during a board meeting the Disney movie tied into her students’ Earth science lesson and did not have sexually inappropriate content. “The word indoctrination is thrown around a lot right now, but it seems that those who are using it are using it as a defense tactic for their own fear-based beliefs without understanding the true meaning of the word,” Barbee said.  RELATED:Disney Recasts Kahiau Machado In ‘Lilo & Stitch’ Live-Action Remake Due To His Past Use Of Racial Slurs  Hernando County’s school district confirmed a fifth-grade teacher is being investigated for showing “Strange World,” and that a parent complained to the principal about the movie not being appropriate for students.  Barbee said that every student in her class had a signed parent permission slip that said PG movies were allowed. She also alleges board member, Shannon Rodriguez called her father to tell him about the DOE complaint.  “I’m a first-year teacher. I’ve had to learn so much this year,” she told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida. “I work with teachers who have taught for 20 years, 30 years, tell me every day it never used to be like this. Times have changed so much and they are so micromanaged, they’re not allowed to teach anymore. They’re basically a caregiver who has to teach the standards. Teachers stay for the children, but because of the laws and the fear of being let go for saying one wrong thing, they can’t connect to their students.”  RELATED:Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Declares End To ‘Corporate Kingdom,’ After Signing Bill Reclaiming State Control Of Disney’s Special Tax District  At the end of the school board meeting, Rodriguez said Barbee broke school policy because she did not get the specific movie approved by school administration and said the teacher is “playing the victim.”  “It is not a teacher’s job to impose their beliefs upon a child: religious, sexual orientation, gender identity, any of the above. But allowing movies such as this assist teachers in opening a door, and please hear me, they assist teachers in opening the door for conversations that have no place in our classrooms,” Rodriguez said.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, is embroiled in a highly visible feud with Disney, one of the largest entertainment companies in the nation. His battle has reached the point that Disney is now planning to curtail investments in its Florida campus, canceling its intention to build a $1 billion office complex.  A feud of this sort between an elected official and a corporate giant — Disney employs more than 75,000 people in Florida alone — makes no sense. Yet such activities occur when individuals exploit their position of power against entities that are not beholden to them.  This very public battle between DeSantis and Disney demonstrates that they are on opposite sides of the political spectrum. According to the Republican National Committee, “the Republican Party has always stood for freedom, prosperity, and opportunity.” Is Ron DeSantis exuding such principles in his battle with Disney?  To make such an assessment, let’s look at these three principles and see how DeSantis’s actions stack up.  Freedom: The feud between DeSantis and Disney was sparked when Disney criticized a Florida education law that places restrictions on gender identity and sexual orientation instruction in schools.  The First Amendment gives any individual or entity the right to freedom of speech. Elected officials are regularly criticized; Disney’s reaction to the Florida law was exercising this right.  The Republican Party must recognize that some LGBTQ members are members of their party as well. No political party is a single-issue entity. To win elections at any level, leaving “votes on the table” is a losing gambit at the ballot box.  If DeSantis supports freedom, this must include freedom of speech, even on a law that many Republicans are in agreement on.  Prosperity: Disney has made tremendous investments in central Florida that continue to pay dividends both for the company and the state.  Disney can certainly decide to pack up and move to an environment that is more consistent with its values. However, Disney knows that DeSantis is one election away from being irrelevant in Florida. As such, any threats or posturing is likely just part of the negotiations that Disney is undertaking while it waits out the hurricane of legislation that DeSantis throws at it.  DeSantis’s move to strip Disney of its special tax status would be what some would label a Democrat-leaning economic policy, which is to tax a wealthy corporation for the benefit of the community (though in this case, taxing Disney reeks of retribution, not sound fiscal policy). If DeSantis supports prosperity, he should build bridges, not create barbed wire fences, between himself and Disney. The economic value that Disney brings to the state benefits all Floridians.  Opportunity: Both Democrats and Republics support policies that create opportunities for success. Where they differ is how to achieve that.  One consequence of engaging a private entity in a public battle with an elected official is the negative perception. Governors are the leaders of their states. They represent the people and are charged to act in the best interests of all its residents. Is alienating one of the largest employers in your state sound policy? Does it give other companies the incentive to move into your state, particularly those with leadership that does not share the same political views?  Without creating a welcoming environment for people and corporations, opportunities may be lost in the future, which ultimately hurts residents.  If DeSantis supports opportunity, he should not be engaging in public battles with private corporations that can be viewed as retaliatory. This does nothing more than suppress opportunities within the state.  As a Republican, DeSantis purports to espouse the principles of freedom, prosperity and opportunity that define the party. His reaction to Disney appears antithetical to them, both in spirit and in practice. If anything, they embody confinement, retaliatory taxation and adversity.  With DeSantis officially now in the 2024 presidential race, the Disney debacle will only add more attention to him and his announcement. In the primaries, Republican voters will have to decide what they stand for, and whether DeSantis lives up to that. But even then, the larger question that remains for all voters is: Is this what America wants?  Sheldon H. Jacobson, Ph.D., is a founder professor in computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. A data scientist, he applies his expertise in data-driven risk-based decision-making to evaluate and inform public policy. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nGovernor Ron DeSantis of Florida is in a public feud with Disney, which is planning to curtail investments in its Florida campus. \nDeSantis' actions appear to be antithetical to the Republican Party's principles of freedom, prosperity, and opportunity.\nDisney's criticism of a Florida education law sparked the feud, which is an example of an elected official exploiting their power against an entity not beholden to them.\nThe larger question remains for all voters: Is this what America wants?<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article examines the feud between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Disney, and how it relates to the Republican Party's principles of freedom, prosperity, and opportunity.\nIt argues that DeSantis' actions are antithetical to these principles, and questions whether this is what America wants.\nThe article suggests that DeSantis' actions could suppress opportunities within the state, and that Republican voters will have to decide if he lives up to their values in the 2024 presidential race."

        "text": "Donald Trump is under fire from Republicans for complimenting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un after his country was admitted to the World Health Organisation’s Executive Board.  “Congratulations to Kim Jung Un!” the former president wrote on Truth Social, misspelling his name while sharing news of the admission.  The post drew immediate condemnation from GOP presidential candidates and state party leaders - including his top 2024 rival Ron DeSantis.  Asked about the post at an Iowa campaign event on Saturday, the Florida governor said: “I was surprised to see that. I mean, one, Kim Jong-un is a murderous dictator.”  Mr DeSantis noted that North Korea recently sentenced a family with a young infant to life in prison - before shifting his condemnation to the WHO.  “The World Health Organisation is a bankrupt organisation,” he said. “Like, Kim Jong-un is bad but joining that, we need to be getting out of that, and rejecting the WHO lockdown treaty and not congratulating about being involved in the WHO.”  Nikki Haley, Mr Trump’s former UN ambassador and another 2024 opponent, also rebuked Mr Trump.  “Kim Jong Un starves his own people,” Ms Haley said on Twitter.  “It’s a total farce that North Korea has a leading role at the World Health Organisation.”  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp wrote: “Taking our country back from Joe Biden does not start with congratulating North Korea’s murderous dictator.”  Former GOP Maryland governor Larry Page also derided Mr Trump: “Kim Jong-un is an enemy of America who threatens peace and freedom. The fact that Trump delusionally believes otherwise makes him a useful idiot for China and unfit to be president.”  Mr Trump famously enjoyed a warm relationship with Mr Kim during his one-term presidency, frequently praising the 39-year-old despot and becoming the first sitting US leader to visit the isolated communist country.  He even bragged about exchanging “love letters” with Mr Kim, who frequently threatens the US and its allies with nuclear attack.  Others pointed out the peculiarity of their relationship.  “Fanboying a murderous dictator while misspelling his name is very on-brand for him,” actor Mark Hamill wrote on Twitter.  © Provided by The Independent Donald Trump congratulated Kim Jong-un for North Korea’s admission to WHO board (Associated Press)  Dr Jong Min Pak this week became the first North Korean official to be appointed for a three-year term to the WHO’s executive board.  “What this means is that one of the world’s most horrific regimes is now a part of a group that sets and enforces the standards and norms for the global governance of health care,” UN Watch executive director Hillel Neuer said in a statement.  “It is an absurd episode for a key UN agency that is in much need of self-reflection and reform.”  Others to join the executive board are Australia, Barbados, Cameroon, Comoros, Lesotho, Qatar, Switzerland, Togo and Ukraine.  Several recent appointments of serial human rights abusers to leadership roles in international organisations have also faced condemnation.  Russia took charge of the United Nations Security Council in April, while Iran is chairing the UN Human Rights Council 2023 Social Forum.  A South Korean lawmaker this week said that Mr Kim was obese and suffering from severe insomnia and alcohol addiction.

        "text": "© Brendan Smialowski/Chip Somodevilla/Newsweek Photo Illustration/Getty Images President Joe Biden, pictured here with Kentucky Republican Congressman James Comer (inset) Comer has accused Biden of being directly implicated in an influence peddling scheme, but has so far failed to produce concrete evidence directly connecting him to the alleged incidents.  Social media exploded on Wednesday after the release of bank records that Kentucky Republican Representative James Comer claimed implicated President Joe Biden and his family in an influence-peddling scheme.  The allegations—summarized in a 36-page distillation of what Republicans claimed were \"thousands\" of bank records—said members of the Biden family received millions of dollars from companies in countries like China and Romania during Joe Biden's time as vice president.  While the GOP-led House Oversight Committee's summary lacked a smoking gun directly implicating the president or any of his family members in crimes, Republicans said the documents symbolized a suspicious pattern that suggested Joe Biden was involved in something suspicious, or even criminal.  Not all of the feedback, however, was positive.  Appearing on Fox and Friends on Thursday morning to discuss the findings, Comer was met with skepticism from hosts Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade, both of whom noted the lack of any real evidence in the document to support the claims Comer was making.  While money was exchanged, there was no proof anything criminal had taken place, only that there were suspicious-looking transactions made during Biden's time as vice president under Barack Obama.  And even then, the appearance of impropriety is not a crime.  \"I know Republicans said the smoking gun was the financial records that you were able to subpoena and got your hands on,\" Doocy said. \"[...]Your party, and Republican investigators, say that's proof of influence peddling by Hunter and James [Biden], but that's just your suggestion. You don't actually have any facts to that point. You've got some circumstantial evidence, and of all those names, there's no evidence Joe Biden did anything illegally.\"  And while others—like former Trump adviser Steve Bannon—treated the documents as evidence Biden \"betrayed his country,\" others, like former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka, were unimpressed with the material Comer produced.  \"It doesn't make any difference in the eyes of the general public until there is the smoking gun of, yes, a piece of paper, saying 'I, Joe Biden, changed this policy regarding Romania or Ukraine because of the money,'\" Gorka said in a podcast with Breitbart politics editor Emma Jo-Morris on Thursday morning. \"Are we ever going to see that?\"  Newsweek reached out to Comer's office via email for comment.  Critics of Republicans' efforts on the Democratic side saw the public response as proof that even Biden's most ardent opponents weren't convinced of the strength of the GOP's case.  \"Comer has very publicly led people to believe that he has uncovered proof supporting his serious accusations, but by failing to show any evidence, he's further diminished his credibility, to the point where even his base is doubting his unfounded claims,\" a House staffer familiar with the Democrats' position told Newsweek.

        "text": "© Photo by Stewart F. House/Getty Images Above, emergency vehicles line the entrance to the Allen Premium Outlets where a shooting took place on May 6 in Allen, Texas. Senator Roland Gutierrez, a Texas Democrat, criticized Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick over their response to gun violence in the state after a mass shooting occurred at an outlet mall on Saturday. A gunman opened fire at shoppers and employees at Allen Premium Outlets in Allen, Texas, Saturday afternoon, killing eight people and injuring seven others. The suspected shooter, who has not been identified, was killed by an Allen Police Department officer who was on unrelated assignment at the mall. The incident has sparked outrage across a state that has been trying to recover from a fatal mass shooting in Uvalde less than a year ago when 18-year-old Salvador Ramos used an AR-15 style rifle at Robb Elementary School to kill 19 children and two teachers. The school shooting sent shockwaves across the nation, but also created a new push for stricter gun control measures. Though Abbott, Patrick, and GOP Senator Ted Cruz, among others, sent their thoughts and prayers for the families of the victims, Gutierrez expressed his anger about the lack of action in dealing with gun violence in the state. \"There is a special place in hell even for people that have this kind of problem staring them square in the face and have done nothing about it. I don't care about their thoughts and I don't care about their prayers,\" the Democratic senator said during a TV appearance on MSNBC on Saturday. He tweeted a similar remark later that day. Abbott said in a statement on Saturday that he has been in contact with state and local leaders following the shooting to make sure all needed assistance and resources are \"swiftly\" deployed, and added \"our hearts are with the people of Allen, Texas tonight during this unspeakable tragedy.\" Meanwhile, Patrick also mourned the death of the victims in a statement that read: \"Please join Jan and me in mourning the victims of the unspeakable tragedy in Allen. Please also join us in prayer for the victims' families and friends along with the residents of Allen. We are grateful for our brave first responders who were deployed to stop the shooter and investigate this hideous crime. We are thankful for their bravery and courage.\" However, Gutierrez said during his MSNBC interview on Saturday that thoughts and prayers are not enough to implement solutions for shootings as he referenced the Uvalde mass shooting. \"This governor and this lieutenant governor, I'm sorry but they can go to hell. I am tired of these people saying this stuff and doing nothing,\" he said. Newsweek reached out by email to Gutierrez for additional comment. Abbott is also facing backlash from others including California Governor Gavin Newsom who tweeted on Sunday that the Allen shooting is a \"reminder that @GregAbbott_TX cut $211 million in mental health funding.\" Despite his stance about mental health, Abbott decided last year to cut nearly $211 million from the state's Health and Human Services Commission, which oversees mental health programs among other health services in Texas. Still, he reiterated on Sunday the importance of addressing mental health issues. When reached by email on Sunday morning, Abbott's media team referred Newsweek to the governor's comments on Fox News Sunday. The Republican governor said during his interview with host Shannon Bream that addressing mental health issues is the \"long-term solution\" for gun violence in the country, adding that his state will be allocating funds to help with mental health issues. \"One thing that we can observe very easily is that there has been a dramatic increase in the amount of anger and violence that is taking place in America,\" Abbott said. \"And what Texas is doing in a big-time way is we are working to address that anger and violence by going to its root cause, which is addressing mental health problems behind it.\" In similar remarks after the Uvalde mass shooting, Abbott said the state and society \"need to do a better job with mental health.\" \"Anybody who shoots somebody else has a mental health challenge. Period. We as a government need to find a way to target that mental health challenge and do something about it,\" Abbott said at the time, according to local news station KSAT. In response to Abbott's remarks on Saturday, political strategist Lindy Li tweeted: \"Right on cue, Republicans are blaming the latest gun massacres on mental health, instead of guns. But Greg Abbott was the one who cut $211 MILLION in mental health funding 205 House Republicans voted AGAINST mental health services in schools. So don't buy their b*******.\" Twitter user @fred_guttenberg also criticized Abbott's remarks, writing: \"Your statement is incomplete @GregAbbott_TX. You need to tell Texans the truth and explain why this keeps happening in Texas. You need to explain that your policies failed and that you lied. Your policies are to blame. Explain that in your statement. #AmericanCarnage.\" Meanwhile earlier this month, another shooting that rocked the state happened in Cleveland, Texas, when when Francisco Oropeza, 38, allegedly fatally shot five of his neighbors, including a 9-year-old boy, after they asked him to stop firing off rounds in his yard at night because a baby was sleeping. After a manhunt that lasted for days, law enforcement from dozens of agencies found Oropeza, a Mexican national who has been deported at least four times since 2009. Though some think prayers and thoughts are not part of a resolution, Representative Keith Self, a Texas Republican, argued the opposite. In an appearance on CNN, host Paula Reid asked Self for his response to criticism that \"prayers aren't cutting it\" when it comes to addressing gun violence. \"Well, those are people that don't believe in an almighty God who is absolutely in control of our lives. I'm a Christian. I believe that he is. Prayer is powerful in the lives of those people that are devastated. I know people want to make this political, but prayers are important, and they are powerful in the families who are devastated right now.\" Related Articles Start your unlimited Newsweek trial<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the response of Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick to a mass shooting that occurred at an outlet mall in Allen, Texas on Saturday.\nSenator Roland Gutierrez, a Texas Democrat, criticized the two for their lack of action in dealing with gun violence in the state.\nAbbott and Patrick sent their thoughts and prayers for the victims, but Gutierrez argued that thoughts and prayers are not enough to implement solutions for shootings.\nRepresentative Keith Self, a Texas Republican, argued that prayer is powerful in the lives of those people that are devastated.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nA gunman opened fire at shoppers and employees at Allen Premium Outlets in Allen, Texas, killing eight people and injuring seven others. \nTexas Senator Roland Gutierrez criticized Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick for their response to gun violence in the state. \nGovernor Abbott has been in contact with state and local leaders to provide assistance and resources, and has emphasized the importance of addressing mental health issues. \nRepresentative Keith Self, a Texas Republican, argued that prayer is powerful for those affected by the tragedy."

        "text": "Critics of Bud Light burned empty beer boxes and fired bullets at cans as part of an anti-trans backlash against the brand that erupted early last month. Since then, the anger has grown.  Sales of Bud Light have recorded declines for six consecutive weeks after a product endorsement from Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer, set off ire among many conservatives.  Consumer boycotts typically fizzle but this one has expanded for an array of reasons: a hot-button political controversy over a product with ample alternatives, outcry from political figures and celebrities and amplification on social media, experts told ABC News.  The boycott grew even larger, meanwhile, after the initial response from the company was perceived as conciliatory by some LGBTQ advocates, prompting a wave of frustration on the left, the experts added.  \"Generally, boycotts get called and have very little effect,\" Gerald Davis, a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Michigan Graduate School of Business. \"For now, everybody is mad.\"  Sales of Bud Light fell nearly 25% over the week ending on May 13 compared to the same period a year ago, according to data from Bump Williams Consulting and Nielsen NIQ obtained by ABC News.  The most recent decline showed a deepening of losses after a drop of some 23% the week prior compared to a year ago and a roughly 7% year-over-year drop for the week ending on April 9, soon after the boycott began, the data showed.  Meanwhile, sales of rival beers have surged. Sales of Coors Light jumped almost 23% over the week ending on May 13 compared to a year ago; while sales of Miller Lite climbed 21% over that period, the data showed.  \"In the beer world, there are thousands of other options readily available at similar price points,\" Anson Frericks, a former Anheuser-Busch executive, told ABC News. \"Every grocery store and bar usually has the other options.\"  In all, the stock price for Anheuser-Busch InBev, the maker of Bud Light, has fallen about 11% since Mulvaney posted the brief Instagram endorsement video that sparked the backlash.  In a statement to ABC News, an Anheuser-Busch spokesperson said, \"Bud Light remains the #1 brand in the US nationally in volume and dollar sales despite regional differences.\"  After the initial boycott, Anheuser-Busch InBev posted a statement from CEO Brendan Whitworth on its website.  \"We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people,\" Whitworth said. \"We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer.\"  © Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy Dylan Mulvaney attends the 65th GRAMMY Awards, Feb. 5, 2023, in Los Angeles.  The company also placed two executives who oversaw the endorsement of Mulvaney's Instagram post on leave, the Wall Street Journal reported last month.  The response drew sharp criticism from some LGBTQ advocates who considered it a capitulation to the backlash. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ advocacy organization, suspended the company's Corporate Equality Index score, USA Today reported on Thursday. Previously, the company scored 100, the top rating.  \"More and more people on the left are upset that the company is not supporting these progressive values in a more outspoken way,\" Frericks said.  The scale and longevity of the backlash also underscore the intensity of anti-trans sentiment among conservatives, experts said.  As of last week, more than 520 anti-LGBTQ bills had been introduced in state legislatures, including over 220 bills specifically targeting transgender and non-binary people, the Human Rights Campaign found.  Far-right House Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. last month reposted a video to her 700,000 followers that sharply criticized Bud Light. Celebrities like Kid Rock and Ted Nugent had previously voiced similar messages.  \"This anti-woke agenda and the idea of trans rights broadly has become a wedge issue,\" Maurice Schweitzer, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business who studies consumer movements, told ABC News. \"It has gained and attracted a great deal of attention.\"  Anheuser-Busch InBev stands in a difficult position as it faces frustration on both sides of the political spectrum, said Davis, of the University of Michigan.  \"A dynamic has been set in motion that's going to be very complicated for the company to navigate,\" Davis said. \"What stance could they take now that would make one side or the other say, 'Oh, OK'?\"<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe boycott of Bud Light began after the company endorsed a transgender influencer, Dylan Mulvaney, and has since grown due to a variety of factors, including political controversy, celebrity and social media outcry, and a perceived lack of support from the company.\nSales of Bud Light have declined for six consecutive weeks, while sales of rival beers have surged.\nAnheuser-Busch InBev has faced criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, and it remains to be seen how the company will navigate the situation.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nConsumer boycotts of Bud Light have grown due to a product endorsement from a transgender influencer.\nSales of Bud Light have declined for six consecutive weeks, while sales of rival beers have surged.\nAnheuser-Busch InBev has faced criticism from both sides of the political spectrum.\nOver 520 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in state legislatures."

        "text": "The nation is days away from defaulting on its obligations. The Republican House speaker, pushed by conservatives in his party, demands deep spending cuts. The president, a Democrat, works on negotiating a package to avert a fiscal calamity.  No, it’s not 2023.  It’s 2011, when then-President Barack Obama agreed to a debt ceiling deal with then-House Speaker John Boehner that called for more than $900 billion in upfront spending cuts and deficit reduction, as well as the creation of a joint congressional committee that would find at least $1.2 trillion in additional belt tightening.  The situation is similar to the one President Joe Biden, who served as Obama’s vice president, is facing today. He and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, are pushing their parties to swiftly approve their agreement to address the current debt limit drama before the US could start missing payments on June 5.  Today’s House Republicans may want to look back at the results of their predecessors’ hard-fought deal. Things didn’t proceed as planned, and a chunk of the reductions was ultimately pared back through a subsequent series of bipartisan bills.  “Once Congress took a look at the programs and what was required, they realized they couldn’t make cuts that deep,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute who was involved in the 2011 negotiations.  What happened after the 2011 deal was signed  The joint committee in 2011 was tasked with finding additional deficit reduction measures to offset a $1.2 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. If members failed in their mission, automatic cuts that would slow the growth of expected spending would kick in over the next decade.  The committee did not accomplish its goal, which triggered the spending caps, known as sequestration.  However, Congress then watered down the deficit reduction provisions by repeatedly increasing the caps on discretionary spending in the following years – though lawmakers also included other measures to offset some of those changes.  “We basically unwound this bill little by little,” said John Diamond, director of the Center for Public Finance at Rice University’s Baker Institute.  In the end, spending was curtailed by about $1.5 trillion out of the total $2.1 trillion agreed to in the 2011 deal, Riedl said. This included $855 billion in cuts to discretionary spending over the decade. The reductions affected agencies and programs, including defense, education, justice and the Internal Revenue Service, among others. The deal also slapped a 2% cut in payments to Medicare providers as part of reductions to mandatory spending programs.  Today’s deal  Fast forward to 2023. One of the major sticking points to ending the debt ceiling impasse was the depth of the spending cuts. The Biden administration had balked at returning spending to fiscal 2022 levels, which the Republicans included in their debt ceiling bill earlier this year, while McCarthy’s team held firm.  In the end, the deal announced over the weekend calls for non-defense discretionary spending to be pared back for fiscal 2024, but certain agreed-upon appropriation adjustments would make up nearly all of the difference. Non-defense spending would rise just 1% in fiscal 2025.  One important distinction between 2011 and today is that the spending caps back then were Plan B, said Warren Payne, a senior advisor at Mayer Brown, a law firm, who was a senior Republican staffer on the House Ways and Means Committee in 2011.  “People were operating under the presumption that the spending caps would never actually happen,” Payne said.  Now, the spending caps are among the GOP’s top priorities – and McCarthy succeeded in not limiting funding for defense and not raising taxes, unlike in 2011, he said.  But even if Congress passes this debt ceiling package, House Republicans may find it difficult to adhere to the caps when it comes time to actually appropriate funding for the federal government’s operations later this year.  “It’s reasonable to expect that at the end of the day, we would end up with the same pressures to increase spending,” Diamond said.

Holmes was ordered to report to the prison on May 30 by US District Judge Edward Davila after her plea to remain free while appealing her conviction was thrown out by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  As of tonight, the mother of two mother of two will share a bunk bed in her prison cell with at least three other women.

        "text": "© Provided by Salon Ron DeSantis; Elon MuskPhoto illustration by Salon/Getty Images Ron DeSantis saw the official launch of his campaign to be the 2024 GOP nominee for president begin the way it will invariably end: an abject but hilarious failure. It was announced with great fanfare on Tuesday that the Florida governor, who is desperate for some buzz as his once-promising campaign has faltered before it even began, would ditch the traditional announcement strategy complete with adoring supporters gathered for a big speech in favor of a Twitter Spaces conversation with Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla-turned-alt-right troll. During the actual event Wednesday night, much was made about the \"historic\" nature of the announcement — right before it crashed. And then crashed again. And then again. It was hard to picture what was more darkly funny: How the notoriously ill-tempered DeSantis was reacting, as Musk's failures stepped all over his big moment, or how quickly Donald Trump would race to Truth Social to gloat in his usual illiterate style about it. Of course, this was all very predictable. Anyone who has been following the news is well aware that Musk has spent the last year exposing the lie that was his \"genius\" reputation. When he's not blowing up rockets, he's blowing up Twitter, the social media company he dramatically overpaid for. That this would completely fall apart before DeSantis even had a chance to speak was overdetermined. Related Why Ron DeSantis can never beat Donald Trump But of course, DeSantis overlooked Musk's now-infamous incompetence for one single reason: Meatball Ron has a mind totally pickled by MAGA propaganda. Even before it turned into a fiasco, \"Twitter Spaces interview with Twitter CEO Elon Musk\" was a weird idea. DeSantis only went there because Musk has become a MAGA hero. And it's not because Musk is talented or smart, but because MAGA is desperate for any validation. If it comes in the form of a charmless dork out of revenge for all the cool kids who aren't impressed by his money, so be it. To compound the strangeness, DeSantis and Musk were joined by venture capitalist David Sacks, an authoritarian nitwit whose definition of \"woke\" is so expansive that he assigns the insult to those who disapprove of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. During the actual event Wednesday night, much was made about the \"historic\" nature of the announcement — right before it crashed. And then crashed again. And then again. We did get to hear Sacks repeatedly open up the event by raving about Musk's fictional devotion to \"free speech,\" an especially trollish choice when the candidate he's introducing is mostly famous for being an enthusiastic book-banner. It definitely set the tone: This would be as reality-based as any of the conspiracy theories Musks feverishly hypes. It's not hard to see how Musk talked DeSantis into this trainwreck. The two have so much in common: A lack of charisma. A belief that they deserve to be worshipped like gods, coupled with a wet cat-style petulance when people decline to kneel before them. Plus, both clearly overestimate the number of people still bitter about being that one debate team kid who didn't get to make up with anyone on the bus. Musk is learning the hard way that such a small population cannot make his \"Twitter Blue\" subscription program profitable. DeSantis is going to learn that they certainly aren't numerous enough to win a primary, much less a general election. Trump may be a moron, but he knew well enough that he needed more than the Musk fanboy crowd to win. His coalition is what you need to win a GOP primary: overgrown frat boys, sanctimonious church ladies, illiterate racists, and a seemingly endless sea of elderly white suburbanites who assume \"cancel culture\" must be why their kids don't visit. DeSantis was the one who empowered the woman who forced a Miami school to yank \"The Hill We Climb\" by Amanda Gorman. But you can bet that book-banner is still going to vote for Trump. If the goal was indeed to convince Trump that Twitter is a happening place where he needs to be, then this went about as well as a Tesla catching fire on the freeway. DeSantis, of course, fears speaking Trump's name in public, even on those occasions when he can speak into a functioning amplifying technology. But Trump's presence was almost as keenly felt as the myriad tech failures. Despite press chatter about Musk \"aligning\" himself with DeSantis, I don't really think this happened because Musk is trying to chain himself to DeSantis. On the contrary, this seems like just the latest maneuver in Musk's endless, pathetic campaign to get Trump's attention — and get Trump back onto Twitter. Musk has also been claiming support for Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who announced his presidential run earlier this week. It's all very much like someone who, desperate to get their crush's attention, tries flirting with other people. If the goal was indeed to convince Trump that Twitter is a happening place where he needs to be, then this went about as well as a Tesla catching fire on the freeway. Want more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only. As Heather \"Digby\" Parton noted on Wednesday morning, DeSantis appeared to have snubbed Fox News in order to give this big ol' news event to Twitter. This is doubly insulting since the Fox News-fired host Tucker Carlson has made hay out of starting a show on Twitter, which we can all hope goes as well as DeSantis's campaign launch did. Twitter did eventually get the thing running, but after losing much, if not most, of the potential audience. Those who stuck around got to hear how DeSantis is the great savior of \"freedom\" because he let COVID-19 run rampant over his state. People who actually read history, which used to be legal in Florida, would question whether Gov. Book Banner has read the Constitution he loves to drone at length about. Or maybe I've got this all wrong and Musk really is a genius. Since DeSantis first got press hype about his presidential prospects, those of us unfortunate enough to have heard him speak were skeptical. Trump is fingernails-on-chalkboard annoying, sure, but DeSantis is somehow worse. He's even whinier than Trump and has a tendency to react to human contact like most people do to dog poop. Keeping DeSantis' voice out of people's ears was probably the best gift Musk could have ever given the Great Meatball Hope.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nRon DeSantis' campaign launch with Elon Musk was an abject failure, crashing multiple times. \nMusk has become a MAGA hero, despite his incompetence, due to MAGA's desperation for validation.\nMusk and DeSantis have a lot in common, including a lack of charisma and a belief that they should be worshipped.\nMusk's attempt to get Trump's attention by flirting with other people failed miserably.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nRon DeSantis' campaign launch for the 2024 GOP nomination began with an abject failure when his Twitter Spaces conversation with Elon Musk crashed multiple times.\nMusk has become a MAGA hero, but his incompetence was predictable.\nDeSantis was likely talked into the event by Musk's promise of validation, and the event was further marred by venture capitalist David Sacks' authoritarian views.\nMusk's goal was likely to get Trump's attention, but the event was a disaster and DeSantis' voice was mercifully kept out of people's ears."

Lachelle Jordan, 30, was last seen at 6 p.m. Saturday when she went to get something from her car parked on Fairport Avenue in Cleveland and wasn’t seen afterward, police previously said. In a notice asking for information, police said Jordan was endangered.  © Cleveland Police via Facebook Lachelle Jordan. (Cleveland police via Facebook)  Jordan was located about 3 miles away from where she disappeared, police said in an update.  A clerk at a pantry store on Euclid Avenue told NBC affiliate WKYC of Cleveland that Jordan had entered the store Thursday evening and asked to use the phone.  Her condition was not clear, but she was “conveyed to the Cleveland Clinic for medical treatment,” authorities said.  Jordan is a Cleveland EMT and a mother of two, WKYC has reported.  A $5,000 reward for information had been announced Wednesday by Crime Stoppers of Cuyahoga County.  Jordan was supposed to make a court appearance Monday in connection with a rape case involving a former co-worker, 65-year-old Michael Stennett, WKYC reported. He was indicted last May on two charges of rape and one count of abduction, court records show.  In the Monday hearing, the state and the defense asked for the pretrial hearing to be continued because Jordan had \"dropped out of sight, and the state is attempting to find her,” the court docket said.  The pretrial hearing was continued to May 30.  Stennett was out on bond at the time of Jordan's disappearance but was arrested early Monday and booked into the Cuyahoga County Corrections Center, online booking records show. The Cleveland Police Department said he was arrested in connection with violating a temporary protective order. Sources told WKYC that protective order was filed by Jordan.  NBC News has reached out to Stennett’s attorney for comment.  Police have not said whether Stennett was involved in Jordan's disappearance.  Jordan's father, Joe Jordan, told the station that it was out of character for his daughter to vanish.  “For Lachelle to go missing, that is unusual, and we’re going to find her.

        "text": "© Joshua Lott/The Washington Post St. Tammany Parish library director Kelly LaRocca on Feb. 13 shows off books that were removed from the shelves at the Peter L. “Pete” Gitz Library in Madisonville, La., because of objections by people in the area.  The Bible has been removed from libraries in a Utah school district after being challenged by a person making a jab at book bans.  After a state law allowing school districts to pull “pornographic or indecent” books from schools was passed last year, someone in the Davis School District submitted a complaint about the King James Bible, arguing the text was “pornographic by our new definition.”  A school district committee determined that the Bible was not age-appropriate for elementary and middle-schoolers, though it ruled that the text does not contain the type of “sensitive material” the law seeks to keep out of schools.  The Bible was pulled from seven or eight elementary and middle schools and will stay in high school libraries, Davis School District spokesman Chris Williams said via email. The decision has been appealed by another person in the district.  The Bible’s journey through the Davis School District review process, the semester after Utah’s new law made it one of the states with the most book removals, comes amid a national surge in efforts to restrict what students read. To supporters of the Utah law, the outcome was a signal of the system properly functioning; to opponents of book banning, it showed the flaws.  “It does illustrate how even a text of world historical importance can, through the current prism of how books are being evaluated, wind up in this prohibited pile of books,” said Jonathan Friedman, a director at the free-speech advocacy organization PEN America.  Lawmakers who’d backed the law didn’t strongly object to the removal, indicating that the ability to pull books was more important than the loss of the Bible from school library shelves. State Sen. Todd Weiler (R), who sponsored the bill in the Senate, said he hoped the district’s decision would be overturned, but he called the Bible’s removal a “fair trade” for the removal of other books containing what he described as “explicit X-rated content.”  “I don’t feel strongly either way about the Bible in a school library. I think there’s probably good arguments on both sides of that,” Weiler told The Washington Post, “but I think that this whole petition to remove it was an attempt to make a mockery of the statute that we passed in Utah.”  The challenge was one person’s tactic for protesting the type of book bans that have proliferated across the country since 2021, frequently targeting books by or about LGBTQ people and people of color. Supporters of the policies say they are keeping children from seeing age-inappropriate material, while free-speech advocates say book challenges allow a minority to control the ideas others engage with and limits young people’s education.  The book challenges are part of a political and cultural battle playing out in school districts and state capitals over how schools instruct students on race, racism, history, sexuality and other issues, and how much power parent groups should have in influencing curriculum. The Education Department has said such removals could violate students’ civil rights.  In recent months, not only books but plays, movies and classroom curriculum — often dealing with LGBTQ, gender or racial themes — have been challenged by conservative groups, parents and politicians. In some cases, a single parent’s complaint can lead to a book disappearing from school shelves.  “In many places, it’s very clear that it is an effort to erase LGBTQ stories, an effort to curb conversations about American history and racism or, in other cases, to deny young people information about their bodies,” Friedman said.  In Utah, the school district reviews a parent complaint and decides whether to remove a book. Williams, the Davis district spokesman, declined to identify members of the committee charged with evaluating requests for books to be pulled from school library circulation. Under district policy, it must include a facilitator, an administrator, an English teacher, a school librarian and at least four parents.  From April 2022 to May 2023, the committee determined that 31 books had “no serious value for minors,” so it removed them from schools. The district kept 10 challenged books and allowed nine others for some ages. Forty-seven more challenges remain under review, according to a district database.  About 150 books were removed from three Utah school districts, not including Davis, from July to December of last year, according to PEN America. Nationwide that semester, 874 titles were taken off school shelves, PEN America found, with Texas, Florida, Missouri, Utah and South Carolina logging the most instances.  The person who submitted the request for Davis School District to review the Bible accused the Utah legislature of facilitating a “bad faith process” for taking books out of schools, according to a copy of the December request obtained and published by the Salt Lake Tribune.  “Get this PORN out of our schools!” wrote the person. “If the books that have been banned so far are any indication for way lesser offenses, this should be a slam dunk.”  The complaint was anonymous; parents, students, district employees and school board members can challenge books, according to district policy.  State Rep. Ken Ivory (R), who sponsored the bill to remove “sensitive materials” from schools in the Utah house, praised the Davis committee for reviewing texts.  “We’re very grateful for the review committee to take time to thoroughly review materials to determine what is and what is not age-appropriate,” Ivory said. “We call upon schools to immediately review all materials [and] get those that are not age-appropriate out.”  Asked whether he agreed that the Bible was not appropriate for elementary and middle-schoolers, Ivory said he did not read it in elementary school. He argued that removals in Utah are not book bans because parents can independently purchase the books from stores — including the Bible, which he and Weiler noted many families in the district probably have at home.  Of Utah’s 3.4 million residents, 2.17 million are Mormons, meaning most residents adhere to a religion that uses the Bible.  Peter Bromberg, co-chair of the Utah Library Association’s advocacy committee, said his organization had warned state legislators that books such as the Bible or “The Diary of Anne Frank” could be challenged under the law.  Lawmakers should “go back to the drawing board” and work with librarians and teachers to “fix this law,” Bromberg said.  “Teachers and librarians are being demonized in these conversations,” Bromberg said, “and unfortunately what that means is the legislators aren’t really working collaboratively with teachers and librarians to put in place laws that would work.”  A “very small” number of parents are often in support of such removals, he said, and one couple made 199 out of 205 challenges to books in the state’s Granite School District last year. A recent Post analysis of more than 1,000 book challenges found the majority were filed by 11 people.  “This is absolutely not representative of Americans’ or even parents’ views on these things,” Bromberg said.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nA person in the Davis School District in Utah challenged the King James Bible, arguing it was \"pornographic by our new definition\".\nThe Bible was removed from seven or eight elementary and middle schools in the district, sparking a national debate over book bans.\nBook challenges have been proliferating across the country, often targeting books by or about LGBTQ people and people of color.\nA recent analysis of more than 1,000 book challenges found the majority were filed by 11 people.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the removal of the Bible from libraries in a Utah school district after it was challenged by a person making a jab at book bans.\nIt also looks at the national surge in efforts to restrict what students read, with supporters of the policies saying they are keeping children from seeing age-inappropriate material, while free-speech advocates say book challenges allow a minority to control the ideas others engage with and limits young people’s education.\nThe article also looks at the political and cultural battle playing out in school districts and state capitals over how schools instruct students on race, racism, history, sexuality and other issues."

        "text": "© ALLISON JOYCE/AFP via Getty Images Protesters gather outside the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill where former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks about \"Saving America from the Woke Left,\" in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on April 26, 2023. A recent poll suggests millennials are the most likely to be anti-woke.  Millennials are most likely among U.S. adults to support the expression \"go woke, go broke,\" an exclusive poll for Newsweek has found, despite wokeness typically being associated with their own age group.  A survey conducted on May 17 by Redfield & Wilton Strategies of 1,500 American adults found that among those who had heard of the phrase, 63 percent supported the sentiment. However, than number was higher among those aged 25-34 and 35-44. Millennials are generally seen as now being between about 27 and 42 years old.  The term 'woke' is a colloquialism that has emerged in recent years. Its definition is to be \"aware of and actively attentive to important societal facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice),\" according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.  The phrase \"go woke, go broke\" has gained popularity in recent months as a slogan levelled at companies accused of burnishing their progressive credentials, usually with marketing ploys that seek to appeal to marginalized communities or portray inclusive values.  The results of the poll run counter to the popular narrative that millennials are the most socially conscious group of individuals who care more about social justice issues.  A 2020 Pew Research Center survey found millennials were the most positive about the prospect of majority black and minority ethnic population in the future, while young adults were found in 2022 to be more likely to say society had not gone far enough in accepting transgender people.  The poll for Newsweek found that of those who were aware of the phrase \"go woke, go broke,\" 72 percent of 25-34-year-olds and 70 percent of 35-44-year-olds agreed with the sentiment it expressed.  By comparison, just 51 percent of those aged 45-54 supported the statement, 63 percent of those 55-64, and 57 percent of those aged 65 or over. Sixty-one percent of 18-24s agreed with the sentiment.  The phrase has become a battle cry of those outraged at recent advertising moves by companies including Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Miller Lite.  Perhaps the most prominent recent example is that of Bud Light, which faced calls for a boycott over a partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.  Since it came to light that the beer brand had sent the TikTok star a commemorative can to celebrate her first year of transitioning to a woman, it has seen rapidly declining sales, while the controversy has also impacted sales of parent company Anheuser-Busch's other beer brands.  Those who have pushed for a boycott on social media celebrated this—along with a recent dip in Anheuser-Busch's stock value—as a sign of truth to the statement that companies which \"go woke\" face consumers deserting them, knocking revenue.  Michel Doukeris, global CEO of Anheuser-Busch InBev, told investors on May 4 that the declining Bud Light sales represented about 1 percent of the company's global volume. Financial analysts have argued that the beer brand represented \"a drop in the bucket\" when it came to the brewer's revenue, and there are differing opinions on the cause of the drop in stock price.  The outrage at such brands has been seen by some as a reaction by a minority of conservatives—though the decline in Bud Light sales suggests, in that particular case, the boycott has notable support. This view may in part be because prominent conservatives on social media have been the most vocal in calling out brands.  Kelly O'Keefe, founding partner of Brand Federation, previously told Newsweek that it was \"really a minority on the right\" that was \"concerned about even the term 'woke'.\"  \"They've essentially weaponized the term 'woke'—which has a dictionary definition that almost no one could disagree with: standing up for those who have been misrepresented, poorly represented etc.,\" he added.  But Newsweek's poll suggests resistance to the rise of wokeness is not just a preserve of conservatives anymore.  A majority of both those who voted for Donald Trump in 2020 and those who voted for Joe Biden agreed with the sentiment of \"go woke, go broke,\" it found, with 71 percent of Trump supporters agreeing and 62 percent of Biden supporters.

        "text": "© Andy Watts//Shutterstock JOHN HUMPHRYS - Andy Watts//Shutterstock  Ten years ago, John Humphrys made a documentary about the welfare state for BBC2. When he was growing up in Cardiff, he said, hardly anyone was on benefits. Now, vast numbers are. Why? What had gone wrong? A good question – but, as he found out, a suicidally dangerous one for any BBC journalist to ask. He was hauled in front of a BBC star chamber, accused of supporting Tory policy, then found guilty of breaching guidelines on impartiality and accuracy. I spoke to him about it afterwards: his lesson, he said, was never to do something like that again.  He had run up against a new trend of our time: political correction. If you engage in frank discussions about certain topics – climate change, jihadi finance, immigration, transgenderism – then you can expect the equivalent of a lawsuit. A breed of investigators or self-appointed fact-checkers will swoop, posing as judges of the truth – even if they often get it wrong. What was intended as a test of objectivity, a remedy to “fake news”, has ended up becoming a new form of bias.  I was thinking about this when reading a new book about politics and lies by Rob Burley, a long-serving BBC editor. At one point he claims to have been stopped from scrutinising the Vote Leave claim about the UK sending £350 million a week to the European Union. He saw this as unfair, but was it really? The referendum had just ended and the notorious claim had already been torn to pieces by Andrew Neil and others. So why choose to go over it all again? Would this, in itself, not be a form of bias?  The BBC’s own team of truth-deciders, modestly called “Reality Check”, are rather selective in the realities they check. When David Attenborough’s excellent Wild Isles documentary claimed that “60 per cent of our flying insects have vanished”, it was a starting claim – but one the fact-checkers let slide. It can be tracked down to an amateur study asking motorists to count splats on their number plates. Had Attenborough said that more people die each year from cold than from heat, he’d face outcry and a full Nigel Lawson-style inquisition. The former chancellor faced a three-month investigation by a press regulator for making precisely this claim.  Some facts are seen to be too exciting to check. When the French economist Thomas Piketty claimed that inequality was certain to rise because of his formula r>g (ie: that the return on assets exceeded the rate of economic growth), it was hailed worldwide as a breakthrough. Time to tax the rich! But when the IMF produced a study showing Piketty’s claim to be nonsense, this seemed to generate no interest at all.  During lockdowns, the heretic hunters worked overtime. An outfit called Full Fact decreed that the novelist Lionel Shriver was “wrong” to claim that the Covid vaccine did not stop transmission. She is no epidemiologist, but she was right about the vaccines. The latest estimates suggest that 86 per cent of the country has had the virus, against around 20 per cent when she wrote her article. Jabs prevented serious illness, but not the spread. Where was the fact-checkers’ challenge of those who wrongly claimed otherwise? At the time, vaccine passports were very nearly introduced – on what now seems to be a false premise.  This is the problem. The rise of fact-checking is powerful and helpful in many ways, but is most needed in areas where there is a fashionable and unchallenged consensus. Whenever all parties agree (as they did on lockdown, and still do on net zero and international aid), the biggest policy errors are most likely to creep in. So it’s more important than ever that the major claims are held up to scrutiny. When fact-checkers instead target those who go against the grain, it serves to enforce groupthink.  The Swedes have a word for it: the “opinion corridor”. If you step outside it, you can expect investigation, harassment or to be flattened. The digital era has put rocket boosters on all this as offending articles are more easily shared by activists. There are now professional campaigners who spend all day referring opponents to fact-checkers, regulators or university authorities. And not just for facts. It can be for hate speech or an offence against hazily defined “community standards”. In this way, the political correction phenomenon can multiply, ending up embedded into algorithms.  Facebook has overtaken newspapers to become the number one source of written news. It uses several fact-checking agencies – but most of the work is done by algorithms. One article published by two leading academics scrutinising the case for face masks has been labelled “false information” by Facebook. Why? It won’t say. Only this week, it rejected a column by my colleague Douglas Murray on the grounds that his article somehow violated “community standards on hate speech”. How so? It never explains. Silicon Valley is beholden to no one.  The most controversial questions defy black-or-white answers. The vaccines were good for stopping the spread of earlier variants, but not later ones. Channel Four fact-checkers ask if university tuition fees are “progressive” which is, of course, a matter of opinion. Much of this seems to stem from a technocratic view of the world: that it’s possible to burrow away, find facts and come up with an objective answer. But such questions are almost always a matter for debate: hence, politics.  The Online Safety Bill, now going through the Lords, will make all this far worse by threatening huge fines for Silicon Valley firms that publish anything deemed to be “harmful” and visible to children. What does this mean? It’s unclear: so the censorship bots will work overdrive just to be safe. Sir Keir Starmer may tighten things further as prime minister, forcing newspapers to accept state regulation. Those who refuse would be forced to pay the fee of anyone who sues, win or lose.  A decade after John Humphrys documentary, the question still hangs unanswered: what went so wrong with welfare? But given what happened to him, it may be quite a while before anyone makes a television documentary asking the question again. It would be tragic if, as the digital world opens ever-more possibilities, the opinion corridor ends up narrower than ever.

        "text": "© Thomson Reuters FILE PHOTO: Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee hearing in Washington WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House Oversight Committee's Chairman James Comer opened a probe Thursday into U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan's management of the agency, citing complaints of abuse of power. Khan has angered companies and trade groups like the Chamber of Commerce by pushing the FTC, which enforces antitrust law and laws against deceptive marketing, to be more aggressive in investigations and law enforcement. In a letter to Khan and agency officials dated Thursday, Comer cited complaints made by former commissioner Christine Wilson, a Republican. \"We are concerned that the developments at the Commission cataloged by Commissioner Wilson and others could undermine consumers' and markets' confidence in the Commission's ability to perform its functions effectively and with integrity,\" Comer wrote in the letter. Comer's letter cited Wilson's concern over a transaction by Meta Platforms. She had accused Khan of abuse of power by voting to challenge Meta's acquisition of virtual reality content maker Within. Wilson argued that Khan had said before coming to the FTC that Meta should be barred from making additional acquisitions, and that this meant Khan should be recused from FTC deliberations regarding the deal. The FTC lost a court fight aimed at stopping that transaction and the deal went forward. \"Under Chair Khan, the FTC is proud to be defending American consumers from harm and ensuring fair competition in the economy. We look forward to working with Congress to dispel former Commissioner Wilson's imaginative allegations,\" FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said in an email.

        "text": "© Getty Images  Amidst the continuing debt ceiling crisis and stop-start negotiations between the White House and House Republicans, a disappointing realization for liberals is sinking in: President Biden will likely end up making substantial concessions on spending cuts to avert the crisis.  So, many are asking: Did Biden and Democrats screw this whole thing up?  After the last time we had a showdown like this, in 2011, many Democrats concluded their own party had botched it. They believed President Obama should not have negotiated with Republicans on the debt ceiling, that he gave away too much on spending, and that he emboldened the GOP to make similar demands in the future.  Yet despite Biden’s initial talk of holding firm and not negotiating, and despite liberal commentators’ dreams of using executive authority to defuse the debt ceiling bomb, things seem to have ended up in exactly the same place.  To understand why, it’s worth retracing the tactical and strategic choices that the White House and congressional Democrats made over the past several months. Some indeed have held up poorly.  But in my view liberals’ expectations of holding strong with a refusal to negotiate, or in circumventing congressional Republicans entirely, were untethered from reality. There was no obvious and achievable way to avoid this crisis. Spending cuts of some kind were inevitable once the GOP took the House, and the question remaining is just how bad they’ll end up being.  The White House’s strategy — and how it went wrong — briefly explained  To avoid repeating what they saw as Obama’s mistakes, Biden’s White House started off with a two-pronged strategy.  First, they said they wouldn’t negotiate over the debt ceiling at all, demanding it be off the table — though the catch here is that they always knew they’d have to negotiate with the GOP over spending later this year. Republicans control the House and government funding expires September 30, so there would always have to be talks about funding the government, which falls in the category of normal politics.  Second, Biden and his allies tried to call attention to extreme Republican policy demands, attempting to win a battle of public opinion so the GOP would back down.  We saw this strategy in action during the State of the Union address in February, when Biden claimed some Republicans wanted “Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.” A few Republicans did back proposals like this, and the entitlement programs had been in the GOP’s crosshairs in the past. But during Biden’s speech, Republican members of Congress loudly protested the president’s claim, and the chamber was soon filled with bipartisan cheers in defense of the two entitlement programs for seniors.  In March, Biden released his own budget, and started calling on House Republicans to come up with a budget of their own. Now, when the 2011 crisis took place, it had proven quite difficult for the GOP to agree on anything that they could pass through the House. This year, McCarthy’s slim majority and his difficulty lining up the votes to become speaker seemed like it could herald similar disarray.  The White House bet may have been that McCarthy would fall flat — and that perhaps, as a result, moderate House Republicans would split from the party to pass a “clean” debt ceiling increase. Or maybe Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell would swoop in, cut a deal, and save the day.  That’s not how it worked out. Defying Washington’s expectations, McCarthy passed his spending plan through the House in late April (containing no cuts to Social Security or Medicare), and GOP moderates and McConnell remained in lockstep with him.  McCarthy also began needling Biden over his refusal to negotiate over the debt ceiling. Suddenly it was Biden who looked like the unreasonable one — after all, McCarthy just wanted to talk (about major spending cuts while keeping the nation’s credit rating hostage). Outside business groups and some Democratic moderates started pressuring Biden to talk.  So, eventually, he caved and did talk.  Biden should have talked first, but kept his executive authority options open  Yet there was a road not taken all this time.  Since the last crisis, liberal commentators have proposed various clever-sounding workarounds through which, they argue, the administration could effectively defuse the debt ceiling bomb without Congress at all. Perhaps the administration could cite the 14th Amendment in arguing the debt ceiling is unconstitutional, or they could issue a novel sort of debt, or they could mint a platinum coin worth $1 trillion.  The administration reportedly explored these options but concluded there were major legal, political, or economic risks for all of them. One fear was that the markets would react poorly and Biden would get the blame for having proposed some wacky scheme.  Another was that the conservative-dominated Supreme Court would never go along with any of these plans.  I agree with Ezra Klein that all these hesitations made sense — these ideas are fun for pundits to spitball but the president actually has responsibility for not blowing up the economy.  The problem is that admitting these ideas won’t work makes for bad negotiating strategy. Rather than high-handedly saying they wouldn’t deign to talk with McCarthy at all, in my view the better approach would have been to hammer home a different message all year: “We’ll talk about anything. We want a reasonable deal. But we’re exploring all our options in case Republicans simply refuse to be reasonable.”  Rather than refusing to come to the table for so long, Biden should have talked but been prepared to walk away, as one leading authority on negotiations would advise:  Instead, various Biden officials publicly and privately pooh-poohed the executive power options, and as recently as this Sunday Biden’s comments were muddled. He claimed he was “looking at the 14th Amendment” and that “I think we have the authority,” but probably that he couldn’t settle that quickly enough to prevent a default on the debt.  “We have not come up with a unilateral action that could succeed in a matter of two weeks or three weeks,” he said. (One motivation for this may have been to talk down Democrats on the left who are urging him to use the 14th Amendment.)  Why didn’t Democrats raise the debt ceiling when they controlled Congress last year?  In continuing the second-guessing, it’s also worth looking back further, before Republicans took over the House.  With Democrats in control of both chambers of Congress, why didn’t they simply increase the debt ceiling themselves?  Theoretically, it would have been possible for Democrats to use the special “budget reconciliation” process to pass a debt ceiling increase with their party’s votes alone — avoiding a Republican filibuster. Yet despite some discussion about this toward the end of 2022, including during the lame-duck session after the GOP’s House win was clear, party leadership seems to have never really seriously considered trying it.  There were various reasons for hesitating. One such reason doesn’t make Democrats look great — members of Congress generally like sharing partisan responsibility for a debt ceiling increase (not to mention that the budget reconciliation process is complex and it would have taken a while when Congress wanted to get out of town over the holidays).  But the most convincing reason for not bothering was the overwhelming likelihood that Democrats would have failed to get the votes from their own party, and specifically from Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona for a party-line debt ceiling vote.  Manchin’s whole schtick is that he wants more bipartisanship, and he was urging Biden to negotiate with Speaker McCarthy this year. So why in the world would he have backed a partisan debt ceiling effort months before the deadline?  Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) recently claimed to Politico that he thinks he could have gotten Manchin’s vote, but this seems like utterly wishful thinking to me — Manchin is still considering running for reelection in his deeply red state in 2024, after all. Sinema, meanwhile, was quitting the Democratic Party to become an independent around this time, suggesting she likely wouldn’t play ball with Democrats on this either.  Another reason for hesitation is that a likely failed partisan debt-ceiling push could have derailed year-end talks with Republicans over a government funding bill. Those negotiations ended up succeeding and included important election reforms aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2020 election crisis in 2024.  So in the end, Democrats decided to pursue policy that they thought (correctly) had a good chance of becoming law, rather than betting on their (highly dubious) ability to strong-arm Manchin and Sinema.  So getting to this point has been a bit of a mess. But it isn’t yet clear how consequential these missteps were. Again, keep in mind that White House negotiations with Republicans over spending levels were unavoidable, since a government shutdown deadline looms later this year. They were already going to have to negotiate on the spending.  Now, Republicans hoped (and Democrats feared) that threatening economic calamity from a debt default might provoke Biden into making more serious concessions than he would have made in ordinary spending talks, if only a government shutdown was on the table. That is plausible, and explains why the White House didn’t want to negotiate on the debt ceiling. But they failed to avoid that.  The question now is whether Biden will end up getting a worse deal because of these negotiating missteps — and to assess that, we need a deal.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nPresident Biden has likely made concessions on spending cuts to avert the debt ceiling crisis.\nBiden's initial strategy of refusing to negotiate with Republicans and attempting to win a battle of public opinion failed.\nDemocrats considered using the budget reconciliation process to pass a debt ceiling increase, but failed to get enough votes.\nThe White House's missteps may have resulted in a worse deal for Biden in the negotiations.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe article discusses the tactical and strategic choices made by the White House and congressional Democrats in the current debt ceiling crisis.\nIt examines why the White House's strategy of refusing to negotiate and attempting to win a battle of public opinion failed, and why the administration chose not to pursue executive power options.\nIt also looks back to when Democrats controlled Congress and why they chose not to increase the debt ceiling themselves.\nUltimately, the article suggests that it is still unclear how consequential the missteps of the White House and Democrats have been, and that the outcome of the negotiations will determine the severity of the spending cuts."

They don't even know what that is,\" Schoening told CNN. \"When you ask that, you're planting the seed in their minds, that they maybe should identify as another gender or that identifying as another gender is hip or cool - 'Hey, my teacher's asking me, so maybe this is what I should do.'\"  Lopez flatly rejected Schoening's claim.  \"That's not happening,\" she said of Schoening's scenario. \"We're not going around saying, 'OK, you know, I want you to think about it, what gender are you?'

By requiring schools to offer equal athletic opportunities for members of both sexes, male and female, Title IX unleashed a period of unprecedented growth in women’s sports.  But this law has been undermined — by the NCAA and by the Biden administration, both of which are working overtime to allow biological males to participate in female sports.  This absurdity was on full display last year when college swimmer and biological male, Lia Thomas, switched to the women’s division after competing for several years on the University of Pennsylvania men’s team. Not surprisingly, Thomas broke records, took home a title, and was named All-American, depriving female swimmers of life-changing honors and opportunities.  The female athletes who were forced to compete against Thomas were publicly humiliated — told to step aside and stay quiet.  To add insult to injury, last month, the Biden administration’s Department of Education proposed new rules that disregard Title IX and, if implemented, will not only allow but require schools to let athletes compete on teams consistent with their “gender identity.” In other words, the Biden administration is unilaterally erasing 50 years of female rights and turning all women’s sports into a free-for-all, unless the school affirmatively determines that allowing biological males to participate would jeopardize fairness or safety for a particular team.  Not only is this unfair, but in many sports it is unsafe to allow biological males to compete on women’s teams. The burden should not be on female athletes to convince their schools to accept this scientific reality, but that is where the Biden administration has placed it.  Title IX is an equal opportunity law. In most sports, athletic opportunities are limited. Teams can only roster so many people. Only a certain number of athletes can race in a heat, play a certain position, or compete on a team. Schools can only grant so many athletic scholarships — scholarships women across this country have dedicated countless hours of practicing to earn, and in certain cases, are the only way these women can afford to obtain a higher degree. Because athletic resources are scarce, allowing even a single biological male to take a spot on the women’s roster means that a female athlete loses her opportunity — meaning women lose 100 percent of the time.  We cannot let that happen. To fortify Title IX’s original equal opportunity mandate, Republicans are leading the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which clarifies that allowing biological males to take awards, roster spots, or scholarships from female athletes violates Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination “on the basis of sex.”  It’s time to put athletic organizations, athletic directors, and bureaucrats at the Department of Education on notice that they may not adopt misogynistic policies that promote “inclusion” on the backs of women. We cannot and we will not let our daughters be erased.  Joni Ernst is the first female combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, and a sponsor of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. Riley Gaines is a spokeswoman at Independent Women’s Forum and a former 12x All-American swimmer at the University of Kentucky. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nTitle IX has been undermined by the NCAA and the Biden administration, allowing biological males to compete in female sports. \nThe Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act clarifies that allowing biological males to take awards, roster spots, or scholarships from female athletes violates Title IX's prohibition of discrimination. \nThe Biden administration has proposed new rules that disregard Title IX and allow athletes to compete on teams consistent with their gender identity. \nFemale athletes are being deprived of life-changing honors and opportunities due to biological males competing in female sports.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the negative effects of progressive gender ideology on female athletes.\nIt argues that the Biden administration's proposed rules disregard Title IX and would allow biological males to compete on female sports teams, taking away opportunities from female athletes.\nRepublicans are leading the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act to clarify that allowing biological males to take awards, roster spots, or scholarships from female athletes violates Title IX's prohibition of discrimination.\nThe article calls for athletic organizations, athletic directors, and bureaucrats at the Department of Education to not adopt policies that promote \"inclusion\" on the backs of women."

        "text": "Arctic explorers have uncovered a jaw-dropping blast from the past which they’ve described as a “hidden treasure”.  The discovery was made in the Barents Sea, about 70 miles (113km) south of Norway’s remote Bear Island.  Researchers were exploring the seabed when they spotted a gigantic crater that likely formed at the end of the last Ice Age, some 18,000 years ago.  Within the crater they found a submarine volcano, around 400m (1,310ft) underwater, which is spewing out mud and methane from deep below the Earth’s crust.  Sign up for our free Indy100 weekly newsletter  \"Exploring the seabed and discovering new methane seeps is like finding hidden treasures,\" said Stefan Buenz, of UiT The Arctic University of Norway, who co-led the expedition that unearthed the geological phenomenon.  \"Every time we go down to the seabed, we get the feeling that we have just begun to understand the great and incredible diversity of such systems,\" Buenz added in a statement translated from the original Norwegian.  The only other known mud volcano that exists in Norwegian waters, named the Håkon Mosby, was discovered in 1995. It lies at a depth of 1,250m (4,100ft) on the seabed south of Svalbard.  These peculiar volcanoes serve as direct windows into the Earth's interior since they erupt sediments and water from depths of several hundred metres to a number of kilometres underground.  They also offer clues about previous environments that have existed on Earth.  © Provided by Indy 100  Understanding the evolution and composition of the liquids helps us understand their potential impact on the global methane budget and can inform what is happening on other planets, according to Professor Giuliana Panieri, expedition leader and principal researcher for the UiT project.  “Seeing an underwater eruption in real time reminds me how alive our planet is,” Panieri added.  The new discovery, which has been named the Borealis Mud Volcano, is most likely the result of a catastrophic, natural blowout that suddenly released massive methane shortly after the last Ice Age.  The crater in which it lies – which measures some 300m (985ft) across and 25m (82ft) – deep hosts a rich seabed life, which thrives on the steep flanks of the carbonate crusts that were formed thousands of years ago, the UiT notes.  This unique habitat includes sea anemones, sponges, carnivorous sponges, starfish, corals, sea spiders and crustaceans, as well as extensive brush land and bacterial mats.  © Provided by Indy 100  \"During this expedition, we discovered that these blowout craters are unique refuges from human impacts, such as trawling for fragile marine animals such as corals and sponges,\" said participant and REV Ocean Science Director Alex Rogers.  Meanwhile Irena Violan, an Erasmus student at UiT gushed: “As a student who has only seen mud volcanoes on land, it was a fantastic experience to see one on the seabed. You could see the surprise, excitement and joy that spread throughout the team the very moment we saw it on screen.  “My first thought was, ‘I want to get down there and stick my arm in it!’  Have your say in our news democracy.

        "text": "Â© Provided by Queerty Kristi Noem's hate and hypocrisy know no bounds  Kristi Noemâs hate and hypocrisy know no bounds.  Last week, South Dakotaâs gay-hating governor signed a pledge written by the anti-LGBTQ+ group conservative PAC Moms for Liberty to âadvance policies that strengthen parental decision-making.â  âIn South Dakota, weâre building stronger families by protecting parentsâ rights,â Noem announced on Twitter. âIâm proud to sign the @Moms4Liberty pledge to advance policies that strengthen parental decision-making. Parents should parent their kids. Not the government.â  Because nothing says âless governmentâ than a literal governor using her platform as a government official to promote indoctrination on her campaignâs Twitter page.  Moms For Liberty was founded in 2021 by three Florida moms/former school board members who wanted to push their conservative values and far-right agenda onto other peopleâs children under the guise of âparental rights.â  According to its official website, the organization is âdedicated to fighting for the survival of America by unifying, educating and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of government.â  In reality, it has spent the past two and a half years campaigning against things like school curriculums that mention LGBTQ+ rights and discrimination and advocating for banning school library books that address gender or sexuality.  Noem pledging her support for Moms of Liberty comes as no surprise given her obsession with policing other peopleâs private lives, as well as her recent attacks on LGBTQ+ youth.  In April, she vowed to fight President Bidenâs plan to forbid schools from completely banning trans athletes. And in March, she signed a bill banning gender-affirming care for trans kids and teens in South Dakota and forcing doctors currently administering gender-affirming care to minors to stop by December 31, effectively forcing those kids to detransition.  When a reporter confronted her at a press conference last year with the statistic that nearly 90% of LGBTQ+ people in South Dakota experience depression, the highest rate in the country, she blew the whole thing off.  âWhy do you think that is?â the reporter asked. To which Noem replied disinterestedly, âI donât know. That makes me sad and we should figure it out,â before moving on to the next question.  Noem is rumored to be on Donald Trumpâs shortlist for running mates, should the one-term, twice impeached, once-indicted ex-president win his partyâs nomination in 2024. Although some of her recent moves, like signing the Moms for Liberty pledge last week and speaking at an NRA convention last month, indicate she could have her sights set higher than the vice presidency.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  The sexual assault case brought against Donald Trump by E. Jean Carroll was perhaps the only legal proceeding against him with any merit, and luckily for the former president, the ridiculous fracas over the Alvin Bragg indictment and Jack Smith investigation will likely drown out the jury's verdict that he is indeed liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll.  But beyond the moral question of whether Trump deserves a third shot at the presidency is an even more baffling quandary: Why did Trump practically hand Carroll her victory? (Note that Trump was found not responsible on the rape charge and that he denies all the allegations, including ever even meeting Carroll.)  THE FEDERAL DEFICIT ROSE BY 63% IN ONE YEAR  Determining the veracity of sexual misconduct allegations, especially from multiple decades ago, is almost always a matter of \"he said, she said.\" But in the civil case brought against Trump by Carroll, as the plaintiff's lawyer remarked, \"There wasn’t even a 'he said' because Donald Trump never looked you in the eye and denied it.\" Although the defendants of criminal trials often decline to testify, Trump not only made the rare and questionable decision not to take the stand in the case against Carroll; he didn't even show up at court.  Trump's deposition, which was filmed late last year, provided part of the most obvious defense — mainly that even a moronic rapist would not consider a Bergdorf dressing room a terribly wise scene for a crime — but he also appeared woefully unprepared.  For example, there is exactly one piece of evidence that proves Trump and Carroll had ever even met, a photo of Trump and his first wife Ivana, gaily conversing with Carroll and her then-husband John Johnson. Trump's team knew that this was the sole piece of evidence undercutting Trump's claim that he had never met Carroll, and Trump's team knew that the Republican's public defense is that he has maintained Carroll is not his \"type.\" And yet, when presented with the photo, Trump identified Carroll as Marla Maples, his second wife he presumably found so attractive that he divorced his first wife.  Carroll had no forensic evidence, as the one coat she said might have retained his DNA had not been preserved. She had exactly two contemporaneously corroborating witnesses to say she alleged Trump raped her at the time, and she managed to get the judge to permit two other Trump accusers and the Access Hollywood case as evidence.  Carroll's case wasn't great, but Trump didn't even try to combat what evidence she did have. Team Trump will inevitably try to appeal the verdict, and judicial bias could serve as a potent rationale. But if given a second shot, Trump needs to actually show up and fight, lest Carroll prove his misconduct for a second time.

Rick Chow, 58, was arrested and charged in connection to the fatal shooting of Cyrus Carmack-Belton in Columbia, South Carolina, the Richland County Sheriff's Office said. In a news conference on Monday, Sheriff Leon Lott said the teenager did not shoplift from the Shell gas station, despite Chow's belief that he did. \"He did not shoplift anything. We have no evidence that he stole anything whatsoever,\" Lott said. Police said there was a verbal confrontation inside the store before Cyrus left and took off running. Lott said the convenience store owner, who police said was armed with a pistol, and his son chased after the teenager toward an apartment complex. Cyrus fell during the chase, got up and was allegedly shot in the back by Chow, police said. © Richland County Sheriffs Office In this booking photo released by Richland County Sheriff's Office, Rick Chow is shown.

        "text": "© (Richard Drew / Associated Press) Pop artist Andy Warhol is shown in 1976. His posters of Prince may have been works of art, but they infringed a copyrighted photo, the U.S. Supreme Court says. ( Pop artist Andy Warhol is shown in 1976. His posters of Prince may have been works of art, but they infringed a copyrighted photo, the U.S. Supreme Court says. ( (Richard Drew / Associated Press)  Andy Warhol's posters of Prince, some shaded purple and others orange, may have been works of art, but they infringed the copyright of the photographer who captured the original image of the musician, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday.  In a 7-2 decision, the justices upheld the power of copyrights and mostly rejected the claim that artists and others may freely use original works if they transform them into something new and different.  Decades after Warhol died, the Andy Warhol Foundation continued to earn licensing fees for the use of his Prince series, while refusing to pay a fee to Lynn Goldsmith, the photographer who took the images that the artist had relied upon.  Their legal dispute was closely watched in the art and entertainment industries, which rely on both copyrighted originals and new and derivative works.  \"Lynn Goldsmith’s original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection, even against famous artists,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in AWF vs. Goldsmith.  When considering what is \"fair use\" of a copyrighted work, the court has looked first to \"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes,\" she said in a 39-page decision.  Warhol's prints and Goldsmith's photo began as licensed works for a Vanity Fair magazine portrait of the musician, she said. Because the two works \"share substantially the same purpose and the use is commercial in nature,\" the Warhol Foundation had \"no persuasive justification for its unauthorized use of the photograph,\" she concluded.  In a concurring opinion, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said the court was right to focus narrowly on the commercial purpose of the two works rather than on their artistic appeal or value.  \"Nothing in the law requires judges to try their hand at art criticism and assess the aesthetic character of the resulting work,\" he said, joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.  In a 36-page dissent, however, Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., said the majority got it wrong.  \"Today, the court declares that Andy Warhol’s eye-popping silkscreen of Prince — a work based on but dramatically altering an existing photograph — is (in copyright lingo) not 'transformative',\" she wrote.  \"Warhol is a towering figure in modern art not despite but because of his use of source materials. His work — whether Soup Cans and Brillo Boxes or Marilyn and Prince — turned something not his into something all his own,\" Kagan wrote. \"If Warhol does not get credit for transformative copying, who will?\"  Boston attorney Nicholas O'Donnell, an expert in art law, said the court's opinion may have a limited impact because it focused on the commercial use of both works.  \"The court carefully avoids many of the broader questions about the limits of fair use in visual art, which is an interesting choice,\" he said. \"Most significantly, the court categorically rejected the idea that any new ... message qualifies as a fair use in and of itself, holding that such an exception would swallow the fair use rule.\"  Los Angeles lawyer Douglas Mirell predicted the decision could have ramifications for the film industry: “This ruling could be extraordinarily problematic for documentary filmmakers and others who frequently rely upon 'fair use' as a defense for using clips of copyrighted works to tell the story.\"  This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Andy Warhol's posters of Prince infringed the copyright of the photographer who captured the original image.\nThe court focused on the commercial purpose of the two works and rejected the idea that any new message qualifies as a fair use in and of itself.\nThe decision could have ramifications for the film industry, particularly documentary filmmakers who rely on fair use as a defense for using clips of copyrighted works.\nThe ruling upholds the power of copyrights and mostly rejects the claim that artists and others may freely use original works if they transform them into something new and different.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe US Supreme Court ruled that Andy Warhol's posters of Prince infringed the copyright of the photographer who captured the original image.\nThe court focused on the commercial purpose of the two works rather than their artistic appeal or value.\nThe decision could have ramifications for the film industry, particularly documentary filmmakers who rely on 'fair use' as a defense.\nThe court rejected the idea that any new message qualifies as a fair use in and of itself."

Ron DeSantis saw his weird war on Disney backfire again, as the company axed a planned $1 billion development near Orlando that would have brought more than 2,000 high-paying jobs to the state.  It’s almost as if Mickey Mouse doesn’t care about DeSantis’ political aspirations. Either that or Disney employees – and I’d bet most employees at corporations large and small – don’t care for a governor who, on Wednesday, continued a crusade against LGBTQ people by signing legislation banning gender-affirming care and barring teachers from asking students their preferred pronouns.  After signing those bills, and one targeting drag shows, DeSantis declared that in Florida “we are going to remain a refuge of sanity and a citadel of normalcy.”  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  Disney isn't loving Ron DeSantis' definitions of 'sanity' and 'normalcy'  Well, governor, you can have your versions of “sanity” and “normalcy” – versions that disregard how a child or adult might feel about being classified as not sane or not normal – but you can’t have that $1 billion investment from a global entertainment company that won’t abide your cruelty.  That’s where the rubber meets the road in these culture-war games DeSantis and Republican lawmakers across the country are playing. You want to feed the base with ginned-up hysteria over transgender issues or drag shows or pronouns, go ahead. You darken your soul all you want.  But don’t expect companies that have to do business in the modern world to always follow along.

DeSantis is quickly learning why you don't mess with the mouse  Ever since Disney gently spoke out against DeSantis’ now-infamous education law that critics dubbed “don’t say gay,” the governor has targeted the entertainment giant, hoping to make it a foil in his “war on woke,” a thing nobody outside the Fox News bubble cares about.  He had the state legislature strip Disney of its ability to self-govern the area that includes Disney World, but the company outsmarted him at every turn and has now sued him claiming a campaign of government retaliation.  © Joe Burbank, Orlando Sentinel via AP Cinderella Castle stands at the Magic Kingdom, at Walt Disney World, in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., Monday, April 3, 2023.  In April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said he thinks DeSantis is trying to “punish a company for its exercise of a constitutional right.”  And last week, on an earnings call, Iger said: “Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people, and pay more taxes, or not?”  Behold Ron 'culture war' DeSantis: The Florida emperor with no clothes  DeSantis expands 'Don't Say Gay' law. Might as well not say 'president' either.  The impact of DeSantis' anti-LGBTQ laws is clear, and it's not good for business  The company announced the cancellation of the Lake Nona Town Center project Thursday. The New York Times reported that “the company’s battle with Mr. DeSantis and his allies in the Florida Legislature figured prominently into Disney’s decision to cancel the Lake Nona project, according to two people briefed on the matter.”  Clearly, there are a lot of Floridians who embrace DeSantis’ bullying, own-the-libs approach to right-wing governing. But costing your state a $1 billion project and generally alienating one of the state’s largest employers and tourism magnets isn’t the kind of stuff you put on campaign flyers.  Donald Trump will surely slam DeSantis for driving away the Disney development  If you don’t believe me, I have a feeling former President Donald Trump, DeSantis’ main opponent should he enter the Republican presidential primary, will be saying as much any minute now.  © Alex Brandon, AP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on April 21, and former President Donald Trump on March 4.  Probably something along the lines of: “Weak Ron DeSanctimonious just DROVE AWAY a $1 billion Disney development project. He can’t even beat a mouse. SAD!”  It’s not ideal to launch a presidential campaign while getting decked by Disney and trampled by Trump.

        "text": "© Provided by Salon Marjorie Taylor Greene; Lauren BoebertDrew Angerer/Getty Images  When so much Republican behavior these days is too gross to be funny, there's something downright refreshing about old-fashioned Christian right hypocrisy. This time, it comes from Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, a biological human being who nonetheless sounds exactly like ChatGPT channeling a Breitbart comment section. Boebert built her career on sanctimonious, though often incoherent, lectures on the supposed threats to the family of leftist sexual \"depravities\" like same-sex marriage or contraception use. She also filed for divorce last month, a fact that only got into the press this week. This follows other comical examples of Boebert's \"family values,\" such as celebrating teen pregnancy or standing by her now-to-be ex-husband after he exposed himself to teen girls in a bowling alley.  Her choice to leave Jayson Boebert might be the first sign that there's functioning brain activity in Lauren Boebert's skull. As the bowling alley story suggests, the guy is a creep. He started dating then-Lauren Roberts when she was 16 and he was 22 years old. She dropped out of high school to give birth to their first child at 18. They got married two years later. During this time, he was arrested on domestic violence charges after a fight with her. In August, he was still at it, getting the cops called on him for reportedly threatening neighbors.  His behavior when she finally served him divorce papers was reportedly more of the same. As the Daily Beast reports, \"He chased away a process server with an expletive-laden tirade and let his dogs loose when he was served with the divorce papers.\" Jayson Boebert denies the process server's description, including the mention of alcohol consumption. He told the Daily Beast that \"divorce is sad.\"  This story is tasty gossip. But it's also a window into an aspect of red state life that hasn't been much discussed, one which is likely fueling the ugly surge in misogynist rhetoric and policy being pushed by Republicans, especially the men. The dark little secret of red state life is there's a lot of Lauren Boeberts out there: Conservative women who disavow feminism, but, when given a shot at more independence for themselves, gladly use hard-won rights like divorce and abortion. Republican men are getting increasingly angry about even this minor loss of control over women.  The results are ugly. A sexual predator is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Abortion bans keep getting passed, despite being wildly unpopular. And now there's even a GOP push to make it harder for people — mostly women — to file for divorce.  Her choice to leave Jayson Boebert might be the first sign that there's functioning brain activity in Lauren Boebert's skull.  As is well known, the average age of a woman on her wedding day has been creeping up for decades, from about age 20 in 1950 to nearly 29 years old in 2022. This trend is more pronounced in blue states, but only by a small amount. Even in the reddest states like Alabama and Mississippi, women are, on average, over 25 when they tie the knot. The age women give birth for the first time has also risen to about age 30. Again, it's a little higher in blue states, but not by much.  All of this is because American women, whether they live in liberal or conservative communities, have decided it's best to have a strong measure of personal independence. Women now outnumber men in the college-educated labor force. Two-thirds of mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners for their family, with 41% of mothers being the primary or sole breadwinner. Nearly a quarter of children live in a single parent household — and most of those are single mothers.  As anyone who is connected to conservative communities could tell you, conservative women may denounce feminism, but still feel it's important to be self-sufficient. The story they tell themselves is that it's not political, but pragmatic: Finding a good man is hard. It's safer and smarter to be able to take care of yourself and keep your options open. Life without men is often, frankly, easier. Statistics even show that single mothers have more free time than married mothers.  Women of all political stripes will take their shot when they get a chance to escape bad marriages. Boebert isn't even the only anti-feminist loudmouth in the House GOP caucus who blew up her marriage, once she got elected and got more interesting options. In April 2022, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia trolled feminists by declaring women are the \"weaker sex,\" made from Adam's rib to serve as \"our husband's wife.\" But, of course, she's not talking about herself. She appears to have left her husband shortly after getting elected, and official divorce proceedings started in September.  Unsurprisingly, male leaders of the GOP do not view it as merely an apolitical expression of \"independence\" when conservative women make use of hard-won women's rights. Instead, they're reacting like Jayson Boebert flipping his lid on a process server handing him divorce papers, i.e. they are not happy about it.  Want more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only.  The most obvious manifestation of this misogynist tantrum is in the overturn of Roe v. Wade and the subsequent explosion of abortion bans being passed by Republican-controlled legislatures. These bans aren't just unpopular with Democrats. In red states, voters have repeatedly rejected abortion bans, only to have male-dominated GOP legislatures force them on the population anyway, even by blocking the rights of voters to weigh in directly. In many cases, female Republican leaders seem downright stunned at how extremist their male counterparts are on this issue. In South Carolina, for instance, female Republicans in the Senate joined with Democrats to block an abortion ban, often acting as if it just occurred to them that all this anti-abortion talk from their party was serious.  The dark little secret of red state life is there are a lot of Lauren Boeberts out there.  It's not just abortion, however. As Tessa Stuart at Rolling Stone reported, \"Republicans across the country are now reconsidering no-fault divorce,\" even though it's been legal in most states for decades. State Republican parties are adding the repeal of no-fault divorce to their party platforms, and even the national party looked at the issue in 2016. (And probably would have taken it more seriously if their candidate, Donald Trump, wasn't twice-divorced.) The reason isn't mysterious: 70% of divorces in the U.S. are initiated by women.  As journalist Lyz Lenz writes in her newsletter, \"Maybe 70 percent of women file for divorce because having a husband adds seven extra hours of housework, work that a wife is expected to do. Maybe it's because women, despite also having full-time jobs, still do the majority of childcare and housework.\" A lot of women are sick of it — even women who claim to disagree with feminism. But it's also no surprise that men aren't going to let all that free labor get away from them so easily.  A lot of the culture war issues that wind up Republicans are, to them, mostly abstractions: Drag shows they don't go to, \"woke\" pop culture they don't consume, books about racism they don't read, cosmopolitan lifestyles in big cities they don't visit. But, when it comes to gender and power, the struggle is keenly felt, even in Republican households. Right-leaning women may talk trash about feminism, but, as Republican men often learn the hard way, even conservative women have their limits on how much crap they'll take from men. This is about keeping power over their own wives and daughters, not just controlling some strange women who live far away. Boebert and Taylor Greene may insist their divorces are merely \"personal,\" but as any feminist could tell you, the personal is political, baby.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nRep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado recently filed for divorce, despite her career built on lectures on the supposed threats to the family of leftist sexual \"depravities\". \nRepublican men are increasingly angry about the minor loss of control over women, leading to a surge in misogynist rhetoric and policy. \nWomen of all political stripes are taking their shot at more independence, with the average age of a woman on her wedding day rising to nearly 29 years old. \nRepublican men are pushing to make it harder for people, mostly women, to file for divorce.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the hypocrisy of Republican politicians who preach family values but have been involved in divorces and other scandals.\nIt also examines the trend of conservative women who are increasingly taking advantage of their rights to divorce and abortion, despite their anti-feminist rhetoric.\nThe article suggests that male Republican leaders are responding to this trend with extreme policies, such as abortion bans, and are attempting to make it harder for people to file for divorce.\nFinally, it argues that the personal is political, and that the struggle for gender and power is keenly felt in Republican households."

        "text": "© REUTERS/Gleb Garanich Ukrainian servicemen take part in a welcome ceremony for the first plane from the United States with non-lethal aid, including ten Humvee vehicles, at Borispol airport near Kiev, March 25, 2015. The United States sent additional non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including unarmed drones and Humvee vehicles, a U.S. defense official said on March 11. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said parts of the U.S. package, including 30 Humvees fortified with additional armor, could come within weeks, while other parts could take longer. The aid comes as Ukraine fights against a Russian-backed rebellion in the east. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich America’s Commander-in-Chief just laid another egg. President Joe Biden wants all Pentagon vehicles to be electric by 2030 – in just six years and seven months. America’s fearless leader previewed this policy on Earth Day 2022. “We’re going to start the process where every vehicle in the United States military, every vehicle, is going to be climate-friendly — every vehicle,” Biden said in Seattle that April 22. “I mean it.” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm just reiterated this objective. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) asked Granholm at an April 26 Armed Services Committee hearing, “Do you support the military adopting that EV fleet by 2030?” “I do, and I think we can get there,” Granholm replied. Those who have worn America’s uniform find this jaw-droppingly stupid. “Anyone who has even a little experience in military logistics recognizes Joe Biden’s E.V. mandate as a political farce,” House Armed Services Committee member Jim Banks (R-Indiana) told me. The Navy Reserve officer and Senate candidate added: “As an Afghanistan war veteran, I wish Biden DoD’s top brass had the courage to put our national security before Green New Deal fantasies and call out this harmful and ridiculous order.” ​“I encountered a lot of IEDs on dirt roads in Afghanistan, but no charging stations,” said Matt Pottinger, who served three combat deployments as a Marine and later as Deputy National Security Advisor. “We rely on China for most of our EV supply chain, and that trend is worsening. It was hard enough when we depended on Middle Eastern allies for our energy needs. To put those needs — even for our military — in the hands of our chief adversary is, to use a technical term, pretty dumb.” Biden’s pretty dumb political farce raises numerous unintentionally hilarious questions: Where exactly would one plug in a Jeep, truck, tank, or armored personnel carrier in a blistering desert or steamy jungle? If such charging stations existed, wouldn’t the enemy neutralize them, to hobble US armed forces? If American GIs discovered functioning charging stations, would they halt their advance for, say, 30 to 45 minutes to recharge – at least once or twice daily? Would US soldiers bring travel adapters to plug their EVs into overseas charging stations? “Imagine going to war, you’re in an all-electric Humvee, your batteries are low, and it’s time for a charge, but you’re behind enemy lines,” one Louisianan hypothesized via Twitter. “You pull up to the nearest charging station controlled by the enemy. They let you charge before starting battle. The war continues.” How would the Allied march from D-Day to Berlin have looked if George S. Patton, Maxwell Taylor, Bernard Law Montgomery, and other commanders had relied on electric vehicles? Would Adolf Hitler have left charging stations conveniently connected to the grid and ready for the Third Army to refresh their Sherman tanks en route to the Battle of the Bulge? Or, more likely, would der Führer have ordered SS saboteurs to dynamite every one of those damn things as the Nazis retreated, from Burgundy to Bastogne? Alternatively, Patton and his men could have hauled mobile, solar-powered charging stations, so tanks and other vehicles could boost their voltage while dodging incoming Wehrmacht artillery. Allied troops also would have confronted, in Monty Python’s words, “a teensy problemette.” The skies above the Battle of the Bulge were notoriously cold, dark, and overcast in December 1944. The clouds were so thick that Allied pilots could not parachute supplies to friendly forces who were invisible beneath the dense gray. Theoretically, had Patton roared into Nazi-occupied Belgium under an EV mandate, tapping into a woke, solar-powered grid would have been useless. There and then, particularly around the winter solstice, sun rays were as scarce as synagogues. Obviously, 2023 is not 1944. That said, relying on the enemy’s green infrastructure or schlepping solar- and wind-power generators would cripple US troops as they attacked hostile combatants. “This is more lunacy from the jet-setting climate grifters with zero basis in science or common sense,” said John Ullyot, a US Marine Corps veteran and former spokesman for the National Security Council. “EVs have no place on the battlefield unless it’s aiding the enemy. They would slow us down, crimp our tactical options, and make our forces easy targets against the weakest of adversaries. If Biden steers us into this woke cul-de-sac, taxpayers should insist that every military EV be delivered with a ‘Coexist’ bumper sticker already pasted on the back.” So, what’s next from the geniuses at Joe Biden’s Green New Pentagon and the Department of Energy, the guardians of America’s nuclear arsenal? Why not an electric-ship mandate? US Navy aircraft carriers could stop every two days in mid-ocean, plug into solar-powered buoys, wait 12 hours, and then proceed on their merry way. Why? Climate!

        "text": "© Provided by The Daily Beast Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Getty  Special counsel John Durham’s final report reveals that four years, a $6.5 million spend, and many dining dates with former Attorney General Barr yielded nothing. As a prosecutor who served as a supervisor on an independent counsel investigation, I find Durham’s investigation to be a complete waste of taxpayer dollars.  Recall that Durham was handpicked by Barr to investigate the probe commenced by the FBI in 2016 into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia that formed the basis for the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. The Mueller probe yielded indictments of 34 individuals, two companies, and convictions of top Trump campaign officials.  By comparison, Durham’s investigation sent no one to jail but did manage to lose two jury trials, including the final loss, in which Durham personally got into the well of the courtroom to make various arguments to the jury justifying his own investigation.  Contrary to the expectations set by former President Donald Trump, Durham failed to produce any evidence of what Trump promised to be “the crime of the century”—presumably involving the “deep-state conspiracy” mantra of Trump supporters—and sent no one to jail.  What Durham did do was aid and abet the killing of a lot of trees by producing a 300-plus page report that reads like a plagiarized version of the 2019 report by the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, in which Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded that the FBI properly opened the Russia probe—code-named Crossfire Hurricane—and found no evidence of political bias by the FBI. The OIG’s report contained a meticulous analysis of the Russia probe and offered criticisms of the FBI’s then process for utilizing FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, warrants that resulted in reforms undertaken by the FBI.  Plagiarists usually try to pass off others’ work as their own by paraphrasing and adding a few original ideas of their own. Durham adds nothing new to the OIG report but does sound like he pulled from Wikipedia concepts like “confirmation bias” to make it look like he was adding new conclusions to what the OIG had already concluded. Of course, confirmation bias is a real psychological term defined roughly as how people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. But it shouldn’t take four years and $6.5 million to warn that confirmation bias isn’t among the best practices for criminal investigations or, for that matter, any investigation.  Following the release of the OIG’s 2019 conclusion that the FBI had acted properly in opening the case, Durham immediately made a public announcement that he disagreed with some of its conclusions “as to predication and how the FBI case was opened.” Durham made this statement despite his own admission that his investigation was still ongoing. His statement was greeted with incredulity by former FBI Director James Comey, who said he could make no sense of it and warned Durham: “Don’t be a part of the sliming of the IG and the department as a whole. Do your work.”  Durham at least seemed to have taken the “do your work” part of that admonition to the tune of four more years on the taxpayer dime.  But Durham’s 2019 bravado ended with a whimper, as his report ended up supporting the conclusion in the 2019 OIG report that the FBI had properly opened the investigation, although Durham does quibble over whether it should have been opened as a preliminary investigation rather than a full investigation.  He offers almost nothing in the way of recommended policy change or reform for the FBI besides a half-hearted suggestion at the very end of the report that the FBI should have an official designated to “challenge” politically sensitive investigations. Arguably, that kind of “red team” function is already fulfilled by the layers of scrutiny that accompany any politically sensitive investigation.  Durham also lacks any moral authority to lecture the FBI or anyone else about concerns over political bias when his entire investigation originated with Barr’s efforts to politically weaponize the DOJ. Durham’s investigation was so compromised that his own top aide, a respected career prosecutor, resigned in protest over Barr’s pressuring Durham to issue a report prior to the 2020 presidential election. Presumably such pressure was intended by Barr to help Trump in the election by undermining the legitimacy of the Russia probe. Another lawyer resigned in protest over Durham’s decision to indict a lawyer with ties to the Clinton campaign.  Further calling into question Durham’s motivations is a notable absence from his report of the allegations made against Trump by Italian officials in the fall of 2019. These allegations involved a tip from an Italian official that linked Trump to financial crimes and were serious enough to merit investigation. But Barr and Durham decided to have Durham do the investigation even though it would not appear to fall within Durham’s investigation mandate. Durham never brought criminal charges and there is no mention of the allegations or what investigation Durham undertook in his final report.  In response to Durham’s report, FBI Director Chris Wray stated that the FBI’s current processes, many based on reforms instituted after the 2019 OIG report, would have prevented many of the “missteps identified in [Durham’s report].”  In my opinion, this was an unnecessarily defensive statement by Wray. The FBI’s opening of the Russia probe has been validated, so it has nothing to apologize for. It’s John Durham who owes an apology to Americans for having wasted their money. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nSpecial counsel John Durham's investigation yielded no convictions and cost taxpayers $6.5 million.\nDurham's report was largely a plagiarized version of the 2019 report by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General.\nDurham's investigation was politically motivated and lacked moral authority.\nThe FBI's current processes, based on reforms instituted after the 2019 OIG report, would have prevented many of the \"missteps\" identified in Durham's report.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nSpecial Counsel John Durham's investigation into the FBI's 2016 probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia yielded no indictments and no evidence of the \"crime of the century\" promised by former President Donald Trump.\nDurham's report was largely a plagiarized version of the 2019 report by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General, which concluded that the FBI had properly opened the Russia probe.\nDurham's investigation was widely seen as an effort to politically weaponize the DOJ and wasted $6.5 million of taxpayer dollars.\nFBI Director Chris Wray defended the FBI's current processes, which have been validated by Durham's report."

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Donald Trump  Former President Donald Trump said that the federal government should default on its debts unless the Biden administration agrees to “massive” spending cuts.  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  It’s a terrible idea – so terrible that even Trump’s fellow Republicans are dismissing the idea as “too risky to seriously consider.” Take a look.  Republicans weigh in on Trump’s bold suggestion  “I say to the Republicans out there – congressmen, senators – if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re gonna have to default,” Trump said. Fortunately, Republican lawmakers were not receptive to Trump’s reckless messaging.  Here’s how a few Republicans responded to Trump’s call for a default.  “I don’t think anybody suggesting that ‘we have to do a default’ is wise policy, wise strategy for this country,” Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Ak.) said. Murkowski added that Trump’s perspective would not influence her own perspective. Murkowski also argued that the most productive thing would “to encourage Biden and McCarthy to work together to reach a compromise rather than pushing a default as a viable option,” according to The Hill.  “Right now, the talks are going on with the top four and of course the White House, and now the staffs. What we want to do is encourage that every step of the way,” Murkowski said.  Senator John Thune (R-S.D.) agreed, saying that “most people recognize we need to strike a deal here” and that Trump’s idea wasn’t likely to resonate amongst the GOP. “I don’t think we want to go there with the potential consequences,” Thune said.  Senator John Cornyn (R-Tx.) agreed, too. “Nobody thinks default is a good idea. Nobody.”  Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, also expressed skepticism towards Trump’s proposal. “The only thing I see right now is that the Republicans made sure default is not on the table. We’ve raised the debt limit,” McCarthy said. “The only person talking about default right now is President Biden. His actions, he’s ignored this problem, just like he’s ignored the border, that means more Americans are gonna die from fentanyl. You had 11,000 people just yesterday come across.”  Senator Mitt Romney (R-Ut.) said “Yeah, well, we can’t do a default but we should find a way to reach a compromise. That’s what you expect a president to do.” Romney, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2012, said he believes Trump is rooting for a default because it would serve his own interests. “If there were a default, the one person who might be tempted to celebrate politically would be Donald Trump, because he’d say, ‘If I were president, this would have never happened,” Romney said. Romney added that Trump’s CNN performance showed someone “untethered to the truth and untethered to the constitutional order.”  Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said that Trump’s call to default were predictable. “It doesn’t surprise me he’d say that. The president is a candidate trying to run on a very populist base, and I think he feels like that will position him in place he gets more votes, and I think he’ll say whatever he needs to, to get more votes.”  Fair enough, but it’s still terrible advice from a guy who is currently dominating the GOP field of 2024 hopefuls.  Fortunately, however, whereas Republicans were previously afraid to deviate from Trump’s own opinions or viewpoints, the outpouring of disagreement over Trump’s default statement suggests that maybe the GOP is ready to move on from their corrupted, demagogic former president.

        "text": "Â© Provided by 1945 Kamala Harris  There are many reasons Americans should be concerned about another four years of Joe Biden at the helm, but none so perilous as the very likely potential for Kamala Harris to become president.  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  According to recent polling, only 26% of voters believe the country is headed in the right direction. Itâs hard to imagine things going further south than they already are, but as any realist will tell you, as bad as things are, they can always get worse.  Kamala Harris has a higher unfavorable rating than her boss, a difficult feat to accomplish. Yet with her constant pedantic word salads about space, time, or electricity, she often sounds as incoherent as the President, without the excuse of age.  While I strongly disagree with almost all of Harrisâs policies, I respect her as a woman of great accomplishment. In 2010, she became the first woman to hold the seat of California attorney general. In 2016, Harris won a U.S. Senate seat for California. Regardless of how one may feel about her politics, those are not achievements to be dismissed.  However, in a culture that increasingly places a priority on identity over merit or qualifications, it is clear Biden chose Kamala Harris as a token. She checked all the boxes progressives care most about â color of skin, gender, and geographic desirability. Harris hails from California, a gold mine of Democratic donors. Despite her prior successes, she has proven time and time again that she is not a strong leader.  While Kamala Harris falters in many areas, she is weakest on one of the countryâs most pressing issues right now â foreign policy.  Kamala Harris Is Weak On Foreign Policy  One of the main roles of the vice president is to represent the United States abroad and serve as an emissary of US foreign policy.  With the countryâs increasingly weak position on the world stage, the threat of China looming large, and a military that is woefully unprepared for combat, the need for a candidate with a strong understanding of geopolitical strategy and global culture is imperative.  This is not Kamala Harris.  When it comes to foreign policy, Harris consistently focuses on social issues such as climate change and gender equity rather than the crucial historical and geo-political elements necessary to understand the agendas and motivations of different countries, cultures, and their leaders.  There seems to be a fundamental lack of understanding that there are more pressing issues for most nations than ensuring people have access to gender-neutral bathrooms. Not to mention many do not subscribe to Americaâs most recent liberal stances on social issues, including gender, sexuality, and abortion.  Africa  Nowhere is Kamala Harris more tone-deaf than in Africa. Including Africa in future foreign policy tactics is crucial. Aside from economic potential and access to key defense ports, along with India, Africa has the highest growing population of working age adults in the world. Itâs population is expected to double to 2 billion by 2050.  With significant instability in many regions, China has steamrolled the continent via its Belt and Road initiatives, its aid to China untethered to demands of cultural and social alterations. This could put Africa in dangerous debt to the imperialist nation, as China has lent African nations hundreds of billions of dollars that they may never be unable to pay back. And waning enthusiasm from China has left many high cost projects uncompleted.  Russian influence has also increased in the region with the deployment of troops from the private military contractor, Wagner Group, which has been a suspected player in the Sudan conflict.  Kamala Harris is not the epitome of strength needed to counter such threats. Her recent nine-day journey to Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia was high on emotion, and low on substantive strategy.  Seeking to prioritize U.S.-Africa relations, a crucial initiative for the U.S., Harrisâs tone seemed to be more reflective of DEI initiatives than true economic and developmental tactics to empower independence in the countries. Her speeches included her usual circular rhetoric and words such as âexciting,â âequality,â âliberty.â On her agenda included a visit to a local music studio and skate rink.  While these are nice optics, they are just that. Like many progressive agendas, Harrisâs rhetoric sounds lovely, but lacks cohesive strategy and potentially carries nefarious intentions. Africa is a wellspring of natural resources, such as lithium and cobalt, required to power the Leftâs âGreen New Deal.â Minerals that are often mined by child labor. Harris made more than one reference to a âprivate public partnershipâ between the U.S. and Africa.  The Future  If Bidenâs record in the foreign policy space can be characterized by chaos and weakness, one can only imagine the damage Harris could cause for the United States. Strong adversaries such as China's Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei already have been taking advantage of Bidenâs ineptitude. Imagine their elation at the possibility of Kamala Harris filling his shoes.  Trust me, as an entrepreneurial woman; there is nothing more Iâd love to see than a female occupying the highest office in the country.  However, as an American, I am not willing to risk the demise of this country for adherence to an ideal.  MORE: Kamala Harris Is a Disaster  MORE: Joe Biden - Headed For Impeachment?

        "text": "An Illinois girl whose disappearance was featured on Netflix's \"Unsolved Mysteries\" was found alive in North Carolina last week, six years after she was allegedly abducted by her mother.  © National Center for Missing & Exploited Children Kayla Unbehaun. (National Center for Missing & Exploited Children)  Kayla Unbehaun, who turned 15 in January, was 9 years old when she went missing in 2017 while in the care of her mother, Heather Unbehaun.  Unbehaun, 40, was arrested Saturday in Asheville, North Carolina, on a fugitive charge, an arrest report states. She was released on bond Tuesday, a court clerk said. Her next court date is scheduled for July 11.  A police spokesman said a woman at Plato's Closet in Asheville recognized Kayla from \"published media\" about the case and contacted the authorities, according to NBC Chicago. An employee who answered the phone at the store Tuesday declined a request for comment.  \"I’m overjoyed that Kayla is home safe. I want to thank the South Elgin Police Department, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children and all of the law enforcement agencies who assisted with her case,\" Kayla’s father, Ryan Iskerka, said in a statement Monday through the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.  \"We ask for privacy as we get to know each other again and navigate this new beginning,\" he said.  Kayla disappeared around July 4, 2017. She had last been seen in her mother's care following a Fourth of July parade in Wheaton, Illinois, according to a GoFundMe page Iskerka created days after Kayla’s disappearance. The NCMEC said Unbehaun was the noncustodial parent.  Iskerka said he was supposed to meet Unbehaun on July 5, 2017, to pick up his daughter, but the pair never arrived. The exchange was court-ordered, Iskerka wrote.  © National Center for Missing & Exploited Children Heather Unbehaum. (National Center for Missing & Exploited Children)  According to police interviews, Unbehaun was last seen packing her belongings on the roof of her car. Family members indicated that she went on a camping trip to an unknown location in Wisconsin and was expected to return for the meetup with Iskerka, he wrote on the GoFundMe page.  When the mother and daughter failed to show, the police were contacted and a missing person’s report was filed for Kayla, according to the GoFundMe page.  Unbehaun's attorney declined to comment on the case. She and her family could not be reached at phone numbers listed for them.  The disappearance was one of several cases involving alleged family abduction featured on an episode of the Netflix series “Unsolved Mysteries” in November 2022.  The Kane County State’s Attorney’s office issued a kidnapping warrant for Unbehaun, NBC Chicago reported.  Kayla was placed into the custody of the North Carolina Division of Social Services, according to the news station. She is expected to be reunited with her family and brought back to Illinois.  Iskerka said Tuesday that he was not ready to discuss the situation and that it has been \"really devastating\" to his family and daughter.

        "text": "© Shutterstock Hartin said had she accidentally shot her friend, superintendent Henry Jemmott, after the two went on a walk by the beachfront in Belize in 2021 A Canadian socialite who killed a police chief in Belize with his own gun has reportedly been spared prison time. Jasmine Hartin, 34, was handed a £30,000 fine and 300 hours of community service, according to local reports. She pleaded guilty in April to the manslaughter of Henry Jemmott on 28 May 2021. He died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Hartin is the former partner of Andrew Ashcroft, the son of a prominent UK businessman Lord Michael Ashcroft. Under the sentence handed down by the island's high court, Hartin must pay $75,000 BZD within 12 months, or face a potential prison sentence of 12 months, according to Channel 5 Belize. She must also рrоduсе а vіdео warning against the dangers of drunkenness and mishandling firearms, according to Breaking Belize News. At the time of Mr Jemmott's death, Hartin and Mr Ashcroft lived in Belize with their two children. Over the course of the investigation and criminal trial, it was revealed that Hartin and Mr Jemmott, who were known to be friends, had been at a party in together on the island of Ambergris Caye on the night of his death. Police say that the two took a stroll on the beach before ending up at a pier. At some point, Mr Jemmott handed her his gun to put aside. She later told investigators that she had been drinking, and had fumbled with the Glock 17 after the police chief asked for it back, leading to an accidental discharge. Police found Hartin near the pier, covered in blood and distraught. Mr Jemmott's body was found in the water off San Pedro, Belize. Hartin was charged with manslaughter by negligence, and eventually pleaded guilty in April 2023. Under Belize's criminal code, the maximum prison sentence for manslaughter by negligence is five years. After she pleaded guilty, Hartin told reporters outside court: \"I just want Henry's family to have peace now and I want this whole thing to be behind all of us so we can heal.\"<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nJasmine Hartin, a Canadian socialite, was handed a £30,000 fine and 300 hours of community service after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Henry Jemmott in Belize in 2021.\nThe two had been at a party together and went for a walk on the beach before Jemmott handed her his gun, which she accidentally discharged.\nHartin was charged with manslaughter by negligence and pleaded guilty in April 2023.\nAfter pleading guilty, she expressed her desire for Jemmott's family to have peace and for everyone to heal.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nJasmine Hartin, a Canadian socialite, was spared prison time after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Henry Jemmott in Belize. \nHartin was handed a £30,000 fine and 300 hours of community service. \nHartin and Jemmott had been at a party together on the night of his death. \nHartin accidentally shot Jemmott after he handed her his gun to put aside."

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Joe Biden Speech on Debt Ceiling Deal. Image Credit: White House YouTube Feed Screenshot.  Joe Biden is Not Fine - After engaging in an unwanted game of slip-n-slide while emceeing the Air Force Academy’s graduation ceremonies, President Joe Biden shuffled back home to the White House.  Upon his arrival in the Rose Garden, Biden banged his head on the top of the doorway leading outside of the Marine One presidential helicopter that he had arrived in.  It’s time that everyone admits that which those of us on the Right have known for years: Joe Biden is not all right.  The Old Potomac Two-Step  Nikki Haley keeps saying that a vote for President Joe Biden in 2024 is actually a vote President Kamala Harris.  She’s correct.  Kamala Harris hugely unpopular, not just with Republicans and independents but even among Democratic Party voters. Biden told us in 2020 that he was merely a “transition candidate.”  Biden did not really get to pick his number two.  Harris was forced upon him because he desperately needed African-American votes to win the contentious Democratic Party primary of 2020. To do that, Biden needed a key member of the black community to support his bid. That’s where Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), a scion of the Civil Rights movement and a key leader of the black community, came into the equation.  The two men forged a bond and a political understanding - at least according to many experts.  In exchange for Clyburn’s essential support in the South Carolina Democratic Party primary in 2020, Clyburn expected Biden to pick a woman of color as his vice-presidential running mate.  Clyburn wasn’t the only powerful African-American Democratic Party leader who preferred Harris. She was strongly favored by former President Barack Obama, both during the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary as well as when Biden ultimately picked Harris as his vice-presidential running mate.  As if sensing that Harris’ role was to replace Biden—not just serve as an important backstop should something happen to him—the forty-sixth president worked diligently to diminish her standing in the public’s eyes.  Biden gave Harris what amounted to a “poison pill” policy portfolio, knowing full well that Harris could not achieve any kind of successes with these issues—ranging from immigration to solving the Ukraine War.  Unable to boot her from his reelection ticket, Biden has been forced to now rehabilitate the woman that he knows is supposed to replace him. Still, it was not a guarantee that Biden would ultimately be displaced by the deeply unpopular Harris.  Though, it is now becoming clearer that Biden’s age is catching up with him.  We’ve not even gotten to the most demanding part of the next two years: the presidential campaign itself.  You Can’t Hide in the Basement This Time, Joe Biden  In 2020, Joe Biden was able to effectively hide in his basement, as his once-and-possibly-future Republican opponent, Donald Trump, routinely accused him of doing. COVID-19 was rampant, and the Democrats had fancied themselves as the party of onerous lockdowns (excuse me, I mean, “science”).  Biden’s unwillingness to leave the safe confines of his basement were strong points at that unique moment in American history. Unless China suddenly lets loose another bioweapon, giving Biden the excuse he needs to again hunker down in his basement for the duration of the 2024 Presidential Election, he’s going to have to be out, campaigning.  Biden is already having difficulty in public maintaining control over his faculties. His fall at the Air Force Academy graduation is but one of many recent instances of a weakened body. As the oldest president in history, the octogenarian just doesn’t have it in him to go the distance. The New York Post has reported that the forty-sixth president works a measly 30 hours per week on average.  This is likely because the old man gets tired and needs bedrest. Because he’s 80!  No matter how spry—and Biden is definitely not spry—of an 80-year-old one may be, the fact remains that they are living much longer than the average American male does at 77-years-old. There are inherent health difficulties that accompany such advanced age.  According to White House physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, the president walks with a “stiffened gait” due to a stiffened spine and nerve damage in Biden’s feet.  The cause of these injuries? Old age! And he’s not going to get any younger—nor are there actual cures for the conditions President Biden is struggling with.  Joe Biden has endured endless rumors that his mind is slipping along with his feet and spine since becoming president. The coming campaign will be more demanding than an ordinary day at the White House and will exacerbate any conditions Biden suffers from.  One can foresee the possibility that Biden not only has to abandon his presidency midway through his potential second term, but that he might not even make it to Election Day in November 2024.  Kamala Harris might have to carry the ball forward.  Or, more disturbingly, the Democrats might Weekend and Bernie’s Biden and push his zombified body across the finish line (goosing his chances at victory along with generous ballot harvesting in swing states along the way) only then to discard the forty-sixth president in order to elevate the otherwise unelectable Kamala Harris.  Democrats Don’t Care About You. They Just Want Absolute Power  After all, the Democrats have shown a shocking disregard for democracy and an appalling disrespect for the average American voter.  It’s all a game for them.  And the name of that game is to acquire absolute power so as to achieve their century-old goal of fundamentally transforming America from a constitutional, representative democracy into an unconstitutional socialized system ruled by a cognitive, transnational elite. Remember, in 2020 Biden labeled himself a “transition candidate” without giving any further explanation.  Well, America just might find out the hard way what he meant as the octogenarian’s worn-out body gives way under the pressures of the campaign, and we are forced to endure a Kamala Harris presidency.  There’s absolutely no reason to tolerate any of this. Americans have a real choice in 2024: either Florida’s Governor Ron DeSantis or former President Donald Trump. Either of those men would be preferable to the listless lack of leadership we are made to suffer through today.  A 19FortyFive Senior Editor, Brandon J.

I know it will never happen, but a 43-year-old man can dream, right?  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad   Anywho, I will never forget being 12 years old, sleeping over on the USS Massachusetts, and being awed by the size and scope of these monster warships.  So, the question should be asked: why can't, for example, the museum battleships like the Iowa-class ever make a comeback?  Well, according to an article from my mentor, Dr. James Holmes, from the U.S. Naval War College, it comes down to what I would call Guns and Ammo:  As he explained a few years back in The National Interest, where I served as Executive Editor:  \"hat about the big guns the Iowa class sportsânaval rifles able to fling projectiles weighing the same as a VW Bug over twenty miles?  These are the battleshipsâ signature weapon, and there is no counterpart to them in todayâs fleet. Massive firepower might seem to justify the expense of recommissioning and maintaining the ships. But gun barrels wear out after being fired enough times.  No one has manufactured replacement barrels for 16-inch, 50-caliber guns in decades, and the inventory of spares has evidently been scrapped or donated to museums. That shortage would cap the battleshipsâ combat usefulness.  Nor, evidently, is there any safe ammunition for battleship big guns to fire.  We used 1950s-vintage 16-inch rounds and powder during the 1980s and 1990s.  Any such rounds still in existence are now over sixty years old, while the U.S. Navy is apparently looking to demilitarize and dispose of them. Gearing up to produce barrels and ammunition in small batches would represent a nonstarter for defense firms.  The navy recently canceled the destroyer USS Zumwaltâs advanced gun rounds because costs spiraled above $800,000 apiece. That was a function of ordering few munitions for what is just a three-ship class. Ammunition was simply unaffordable.  Modernized Iowas would find themselves in the same predicament, if not more so.\"  Sadly, if the guns can't fire and there is no reliable ammo the dream of a battleship reboot is dead.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner Confused kid scratching head to solve mathematics problem on board at classroom - concept of intelligence, trouble learning and education.  No child enjoys homework, tests, or the hours one must put in to do well on both. But these tasks are vital to education — and not just for academic reasons. It is through the mundane work of learning that children learn self-discipline and, more importantly, the lesson that success is not given, but earned.  Small wonder, then, that educators are now doing away with these tools. Self-discipline is just another form of white supremacy, according to the Left, as is the idea that people must actually work for what they want. Thus, testing, grades, and any other form of academic rigor are being discarded as outdated symptoms of systemic racism.  KEEPING TEACHERS UNIONS HONEST  Several school districts nationwide have embraced this move toward “equitable grading,” a system in which students are expected to learn classroom material without ever being rewarded for it or penalized if they fail to do so. Under this new model, homework is assigned but not emphasized, according to the Wall Street Journal, and tests come with multiple retake opportunities — that is, if they are given at all. And behavior, including attendance, is no longer a factor in a student’s final grade because it has “nothing to do with whether they can write a competent, argumentative essay,” according to Tanya Kuhnee, a teacher-support specialist who helped implement equitable grading in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Supporters of this approach say it takes into consideration students with hardships in a way that traditional learning methods don’t. Apparently, only students with stable home lives and intentional parents are able to complete homework assignments and study for exams.  “Classrooms are pressure cookers,” said Joe Feldman, the pioneer of equitable learning. “[Students are] now able to relax, say, ‘I can have a bad day,’ and spend more time on things. It changes the way the classroom feels.”  Equitable learning certainly has changed the way classrooms feel and operate, but not for the better. One student who experienced these grading changes for himself said they incentivized poor work habits and noted that even some of the highest-achieving students in his Las Vegas high school have stopped showing up to class unless there was an exam.  This isn’t just a K-12 phenomenon. More than 80% of four-year colleges said in a recent poll that they don’t intend to require standardized tests, including the SAT and the ACT, in their applications this fall. The reason? Because the tests don’t adequately take into account various socioeconomic factors that might affect an applicant’s score.  Proponents of equitable learning believe they are helping underprivileged students, but in reality, they are setting them up for failure. Very few successful people would be where they are right now if they had not been forced to develop the character and determination required to succeed.  Indeed, equitable education is really its own form of bigotry — one that resigns students to lives of mediocrity by never demanding more from them. Why should children from any background, but especially those facing difficulties, expect to succeed if the adults in their lives have already assumed they won’t?

Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas attends the ceremonial swearing-in ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett to be the U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice on the South Lawn of the White House October 26, 2020. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images  A group of fifteen Democratic senators sent a letter in March asking to withhold $10 million in Supreme Court funding.  The senators said the $10 million should be withheld until a public code of ethics is instituted for the court.  The letter was sent before ProPublica revealed GOP megadonor paid tuition for a child in Clarence Thomas' custody.  A group of 15 Democratic Senators wants to withhold $10 million in Supreme Court funding until the high court institutes a public code of ethics, according to The Hill.  At the beginning of April, Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen â the chair of a subcommittee in charge of the Supreme Court's budget â suggested the court needed a code of ethics, adding that Congress needed to act.  \"It is unacceptable that the Supreme Court has exempted itself from the accountability that applies to all other members of our federal courts, and I believe Congress should act to remedy this problem,\" Van Hollen told the Washington Post.  Unmentioned in Van Hollen's statement to the Washington Post was that a group of senators wrote to Van Hollen's Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee just days prior, on March 31, requesting $10 million be shaved from the Supreme Court's budget until a public code of ethics was adopted.  \"Congress has broad authority to compel the Supreme Court to institute these reforms, which would join other requirements already legislatively mandated. And Congress's appropriations power is one tool for achieving these changes,\" the group wrote in their letter, according to the Hill.  The letter to Van Hollen's subcommittee came approximately a week before investigative news outlet ProPublica revealed that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has taken lavish vacations for decades with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow without officially reporting it. ProPublica also revealed on Thursday that Crow paid for some of the pricey boarding school tuition for a child in Thomas' care, also without Thomas ever reporting it.  At a Supreme Court ethics hearing on Tuesday, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley appeared to take umbrage at the Democratic senators' request, asserting the $10 million that would be cut from the Supreme Court's budget would directly impact their security.  Another GOP senator, Ted Cruz, echoed Hawley.  \"The left is willing to threaten the lives of the justices,\" Cruz said.  But according to Van Hollen's spokesperson, the Washington Post reported, his office wasn't aware of any members of Congress trying to slash security spending. She added that cutting funding for the Supreme Court's security simply wasn't on the table.  \"Sen. Van Hollen continues to assess options for ensuring the court establishes a code of ethics, but that isn't one of them,\" the spokesperson told the Washington Post.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nA group of 15 Democratic senators have requested that $10 million be withheld from the Supreme Court's budget until a public code of ethics is adopted.\nThis request came shortly before ProPublica revealed that GOP megadonor Harlan Crow had paid for some of the pricey boarding school tuition for a child in Clarence Thomas' care.\nRepublican senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz have accused the left of threatening the justices' lives, but a spokesperson for Sen.

Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  Hunter Biden Is In Trouble...  The House Republicans’ probes of Hunter Biden’s finances, laptop, and personal life raise a persistent question: Is the GOP actually trying to draw out wrongdoing by the president, or are they just looking to embarrass Hunter Biden?  Last week, the House Oversight Committee released what they claimed was new evidence about the “Biden Family” and the “influence operation” that they had pulled off across several countries.  But as pointed out by everyone from the New York Times to, surprisingly, Steve Doocy of Fox News, the release was light on any evidence of any crimes, as well as that President Biden received any money for any of the deals.  “But that’s just your suggestion ― you actually don’t have any facts to that point. You’ve got some circumstantial evidence,” Doocy, a man certainly not known for going on television and defending Democratic officials, said on Fox last week. “And the other thing is, of all those names, the one person who didn’t profit is ― there is no evidence that Joe Biden did anything illegally.”  A report over the weekend says the House GOP, or at least one member of it, is planning something that almost certainly has no plausible connection to any supposed wrongdoing by Joe Biden.  The New York Post reported that the House Oversight Committee is in talks to bring sex workers employed in the past by Hunter Biden to testify before the committee.  “We’re going to track down these women and talk to them and if there is a credible reason that we need to bring them in front of the Oversight Committee then absolutely we will do that. Especially when it involves our national security,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who is on the House Oversight Committee, told the Post.  Greene said she has had talks with Rep. James Comer (R-KY) about doing such a thing, and they are “working in that direction,” although no one besides Greene appears to have confirmed that such a thing is planned.  “Congresswoman Greene is very concerned about the possibility that the women being paid for prostitution by the President’s son who were foreign nationals were human trafficked,” the committee said in a statement to the newspaper. “She plans to lead a probe to determine if in fact, they were human trafficked and if the Biden family has tried to intimidate them or cover the story up.”  The thinking goes that the suspicious activity reports (SARs) obtained by the committee say that the president’s son paid women for sex, and some of them came from Russia and Ukraine.  “There was an entire stack of papers and it was each transaction, each person, each LLC, Hunter Biden’s law firm, Hunter Biden himself, and multiple Biden family members — then it was all these prostitutes. And you can go through and it gives all the prostitutes’ names, addresses, birthdates, telephone numbers, their passports,” Greene told the newspaper.  Biden’s infamous laptop consisted of numerous photographs of himself with sex workers, often during drug binges. A request by the Biden campaign in 2020 to remove a nude photo of Hunter later became a matter of contention in the Twitter Files debates.  Greene added that she and the committee want to confirm whether the younger Biden ever brought such women to the White House, and cited an “extreme danger” that the women might be spies. However, little to no evidence has been produced indicating that this might be the case.  Perhaps needless to say, there is no connection to speak of between Hunter Biden’s reported escapades with sex workers, and his father.

        "text": "Â© Provided by 1945 Ukraine  The Russian military continues to face severe logistical issues. The Kremlin recently sacked the man responsible for running logistics for the Russian forces. But the situation is unlikely to change.  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  On day 432 of the war in Ukraine, the Russian forces are still searching for some concrete victory on the ground.  Ministerial Reshuffles and Russian Logistics  Last week, Kremlin-affiliated media said that the Russian Ministry of Defense sacked Deputy Defense Minister Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, who had been on the job for only eight months.  âMizintsevâs sacking was not immediately confirmed, but speculation about his future highlights how logistics problems remain at the heart of Russiaâs struggling campaign in Ukraine. Russia does not have enough munitions to achieve success on the offensive,â the British Military Intelligence assessed in its latest estimate of the war.  This lack of ammunition is creating friction within the Russian forces, most notably between the Russian military and the Wagner Group private military company.  The two organizations have been engaged in a bitter rivalry for months now. Although lately there seems to have been a truce of short between the Russian Ministry of Defense and Wagner Group, the underlying frictions are still there and will continue to poison their relationship.  An ambitious Ukrainian counteroffensive would look to exploit the existing frictions within the Russian forces to maximize the effectiveness of its attack.  âRussia continues to give the highest priority to mobilising its defence industry, but it is still failing to meet war time demands. While Russiaâs political leaders persist in demanding success on the battlefield, Russiaâs logistics professionals are stuck in the middle,â the British Military Intelligence added.  The U.S.-led Western sanctions have made the job of the Russian defense and aerospace industry very difficult.  Moreover, despite Kremlin statements about the independent and cutting-edge Russian defense and aerospace sector, Russiaâs defense firms rely heavily on Western technology. Russian drones operating today in Ukraine, such as the highly successful Orlan-10 tactical unmanned aerial system, can fly because of Western parts.  Russiaâs ballistic and cruise missile arsenal, which has caused so much destruction in Ukraine, is dependent largely on microchips and processors from the West. The sanctions have forced the Russian Ministry of Defense to literally scavenge dishwashers and fridges for microchips to put on weapon systems.  At the end of the day, logistics might not be sexy and get people medals, but it is the driving force behind almost every successful military operation in history. French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, after all, famously said, âamateurs discuss tactics; professionals discuss logistics.â  Russian Casualties in Ukraine  The Russian forces continue to take casualties in Ukraine but at an increasingly lower rate. The downward trend continues for another day, with about 400 Russian troops killed or wounded over the past 24 hours.  Overall, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense claimed that as of Monday, Ukrainian forces have killed and wounded approximately 191,420 Russian troops  Destroyed equipment includes: 308 fighter, attack, bomber, and transport jets, 294 attack and transport helicopters, 3,701 tanks, 2,930 artillery pieces, 7,193 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, 544 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), 18 boats and cutters, 5,851 vehicles and fuel tanks, 298 anti-aircraft batteries, 2,477 tactical unmanned aerial systems, 360 special equipment platforms, such as bridging vehicles, and four mobile Iskander ballistic missile systems, and 947 cruise missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defenses.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill The prevailing account says Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is walking a tightrope over a shark tank in the debt ceiling talks, sidling precariously between a federal default on one side and the loss of his Speakership on the other. The prevailing account might have it all wrong. As McCarthy and President Biden race to find common ground on extending the government’s borrowing authority, the Speaker has defied the doubts that came with his arduous path to the gavel, building up trust among his conservative naysayers and creating what appears to be a comfortable space to battle Biden over the terms of the debt ceiling hike. McCarthy has dragged Biden to the negotiating table, which the president resisted for months. He’s taken any tax hikes — which Democrats have demanded in past debt limit fights — off the table. And the Speaker’s success last month in shepherding a Republican debt-ceiling package through the House — despite a tiny GOP majority — has buoyed even some of his fiercest conservative detractors. © Provided by The Hill Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) addresses reporters after he returns from a closed-door House Republican Conference meeting at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, May 23, 2023. (Greg Nash) Those conservatives say they’re not eyeing an effort to strip McCarthy of his gavel, even if they oppose an eventual compromise with Biden. “Nobody’s talking about that,” Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) recently told MSNBC. “We support our Speaker. We want him to be successful because the country needs for him to be successful.” “Literally nobody except the press is talking about removing McCarthy right now,” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) echoed Monday on Twitter. Those dynamics could set the stage for a compromise that looks a lot like the debt ceiling deals of years past, when liberals rejected the legislation for cutting too much spending, conservatives opposed it for not cutting enough — and some motley combination of moderates and leadership allies in both parties came together to approve the bill and prevent a default. “The mechanics of getting there we’re very in tuned with,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), one of the Republicans leading the talks with the White House. More coverage of the debt ceiling from The Hill: McCarthy is not blind to those dynamics, acknowledging Monday that House Republicans were never going to get everything they wanted, given the Democrats’ control of the White House and Senate — the same divided powers that governed similar debt ceiling battles between former President Obama and then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), and more recently between former President Trump and then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “It happens every single time,” McCarthy told reporters in the Capitol shortly before a meeting with Biden at the White House. “That’s what divided government does.” Yet McCarthy’s challenge is not merely in negotiating a bipartisan compromise, it’s also in putting a bill on the House floor that can win Biden’s support without angering conservatives to such an extent that they seek to boot the Speaker from power. “The skepticism of McCarthy specifically has been hanging in the air for a long time now, and sort of is a dark cloud over the proceedings this time around,” said Philip Wallach, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “It’s easy to imagine that dissipating, and Kevin McCarthy showing that once again, the doubters are going to realize that he’s capable of more than they imagined,” he continued. “But it’s also just as easy to imagine things becoming very tricky if Republicans start really tearing each other to pieces.” © Provided by The Hill House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Calif., speaks as he meets with President Joe Biden to discuss the debt limit in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, May 22, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Calif., speaks as he meets with President Joe Biden to discuss the debt limit in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, May 22, 2023, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) McCarthy has dismissed the idea of an internal GOP revolt, predicting he can negotiate a deal that both avoids a default and wins at least half of his conservative-heavy conference — a stipulation known informally as the Hastert Rule. “I firmly believe what we’re negotiating right now a majority of Republicans will see that it … [will] put us on the right path,” he said Monday. Still, the removal process was made easier by the rule changes McCarthy agreed to in January as a condition of gaining enough conservative support to win the gavel — changes that allow a single lawmaker to launch the process of vacating the Speaker’s chair. And Democrats aren’t so sure McCarthy would stage a vote on a bipartisan debt ceiling bill if his seat is on the line. “That’s the big unknown,” said Rep. John B. Larson (D-Conn.), a 25-year veteran of Capitol Hill, noting that the threat to vacate the Speakership is more explicit this year than in those of the past. “Were that not the case, were that Paul Ryan or John Boehner, you would be able to say, ‘OK, I can pretty much figure out how that will play [out].’ But this is an unknown that we haven’t had before.” Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, was even more skeptical. “If Kevin McCarthy is forced to choose between holding power in his Speakership, or taking us closer to default, we know he’s going to choose default,” Aguilar told reporters earlier in the month. Still, Democratic leaders will have their own challenges in the debate, since any compromise will necessarily feature some of the spending cuts and other policy changes Republicans are demanding. Indeed, Biden has already signaled an openness to a spending freeze for 2024, permitting reforms to expedite energy projects and an expansion of work requirements for some social benefit programs. All of those provisions are opposed by liberals in Congress, and their inclusion will test the ability of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the newly installed Democratic leader, to rally his members in support of their White House ally. © Provided by The Hill Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) speaks to reporters alongside Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) speaks to reporters alongside Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) following a House Democratic Caucus meeting on Wednesday, May 10, 2023. Democratic support will be crucial to the bill’s success, because a number of conservatives say they won’t vote for anything less than the House GOP bill. And Democrats are already warning that their support will have limits, too. “Let’s face it, the majority of votes to pass this in the House is going to come from the Democratic side. So we can’t have a deal that is so weighted toward Republican priorities on policy, and yet when it comes to the votes, it’s the House Democrats who are expected to do the heavy lifting,” Rep. Brendan Boyle (Pa.), senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, told CNN on Sunday night. “That, frankly, is just not going to happen.” McCarthy’s conservative detractors have given the Speaker high marks throughout the debate while putting pressure on him to hold his ground. But even so, “I haven’t heard anybody talking about motion to vacate except for reporters who asked me about that,” Good told The Hill. Additionally, any conservative effort to topple McCarthy would necessarily require the support of virtually all of the minority Democrats, since the Speaker would likely be backed by the overwhelming majority of his GOP conference — a step many Democrats say they simply wouldn’t take. “I don’t think there is interest on the part of Democrats to fuel the uncertainty and the chaos,” said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.). “That doesn’t help any of us.” Emily Brooks contributed.

        "text": "© Provided by Law & Crime SBF and Thomas  A pair of unanimous Supreme Court rulings have been making federal prosecutors’ jobs more difficult in anti-corruption cases, and one of the first beneficiaries of these precedents may be Sam Bankman-Fried, the most hated man in cryptocurrency.  On Friday, Bankman-Fried’s attorneys argued that five of the charges against their client might now be on shaky ground in the wake of the holding in U.S. v. Ciminelli, a decision authored by Justice Clarence Thomas. That ruling voided the corruption conviction of Buffalo-based contractor Louis Ciminelli, who was involved in a major development project ballyhooed by former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).  In the process, Thomas — with unanimous agreement from his colleagues — voided the so-called “right-to-control” theory of fraud prosecution holding that someone can be found guilty of wire fraud for scheming to deprive the victim of “potentially valuable economic information” needed for “discretionary economic decisions.”  His opinion, however, found that the “federal fraud statutes criminalize only schemes to deprive people of traditional property interests.”  Related Coverage:  One day after the release of the decision, Bankman-Fried’s attorneys told Senior U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan that five out of the 13 counts against their client may be premised on the now-defunct legal theory.  As a result, they argue, “the opinion has a direct bearing on the viability of Counts 7-9 and 1-2” of the most recent indictment, which made various fraud allegations. Those counts include conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders of Alameda Research, his proprietary hedge fund, wire fraud on those lenders, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers of FTX, and wire fraud on those customers.  Bankman-Fried’s attorney Christian R. Everdell does not contend that the Supreme Court decision will affect the other eight counts against his client, including alleged violations of campaign finance law and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The government’s most recent indictment accuses Bankman-Fried of directing at least $40 million in cryptocurrency bribes to Chinese officials, a claim that would remain untouched by the Supreme Court’s decision.  On the domestic front, prosecutors claim, Bankman-Fried relied upon two FTX employees, identified in court documents only as “CC-1” and “CC-2,” to send donations to different poles of the political spectrum. Prosecutors claim that Bankman-Fried colorfully anointed “CC-1” the face of left-leaning spending by telling this person that the role “will mean you giving to a lot of woke s— for transactional purposes.”  “Likewise, it was the preference of Samuel Bankman-Fried, a/k/a ‘SBF,’ the defendant, to keep contributions to Republicans ‘dark,’” his indictment alleges.

        "text": "© Provided by The Daily Beast Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero / The Daily Beast / Getty  E. Jean Carroll’s latest legal move against former President Donald Trump really turns up the heat on Attorney General Merrick Garland.  Carroll—who just won a $5 million verdict against Trump for sexual battery and defamation in a case filed in 2022 (“Carroll II”)—is seeking to amend her complaint in an earlier 2019 lawsuit (“Carroll I”) to include liability for Trump’s latest insults, which were broadcast live to over three million people during CNN’s Trump town hall.  During the May 10 event, Trump, fresh off losing his case to Carroll, derided her as a “whack job,” continued to insist he didn’t even know who she was, and claimed her account of the sexual assault was “fake” and a “made-up story,” all to the delight of the town hall audience, which applauded and cheered him on. Trump continued his denials and ridiculing of Carroll's claims this morning in a Truth Social post, calling her allegations “fake,” a “Made Up Story,” and “A TOTAL SCAM.”  In light of these new potentially defamatory statements by Trump, Carroll’s legal team has asked the judge presiding over the 2019 Carroll I case to allow Carroll to amend her complaint to include these latest statements and seek damages in the amount of $10 million as well as unspecified punitive damages.  But the case may never reach a jury if Garland’s Justice Department has its way. Recall that Garland has thus far continued Trump’s DOJ tactic of seeking to substitute the federal government as the defendant for Trump in Carroll’s suit. If successful, that would essentially end the lawsuit, as under a law known as the Westfall Act, government officials are immune from suits for actions undertaken in their official capacity.  The defamatory statements at issue in the case were made when Trump was still serving as president. Then-Attorney General Bill Barr invoked the Westfall Act at the behest of the White House after first removing the case from New York state court to federal court.  Such an action by Barr and the Trump White House is hardly surprising. But Garland’s decision to follow Barr’s lead was surprising.  In a widely criticized decision, Garland chose to double down on Barr’s decision and had the DOJ intervene in the 2019 Carroll I case. His decision set off an extended chain of litigation in which the issue was fought over for some 31 months and traveled from the federal trial court to the federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and even to the local D.C. Court of Appeals before finally returning to the federal trial court, where the matter is now pending before the same judge who presided over Carroll II.  Why did Garland do it? Some clues may be found in his defense of his decision, in which he repeatedly invokes the DOJ’s impartiality, and asserts the department is not beholden to any present or past administration.  In other words, Garland is playing his familiar tune of being an institutionalist who wants to protect the DOJ’s reputation by looking impartial. But the attorney general’s decision here is a particularly short-sighted one, and despite having spent the majority of his career as an appellate judge, he appears blind to the potential legal landmines the decision may create for the DOJ’s other investigations involving Trump.  Little thought appears to have been given to the fact that Garland’s DOJ is now criminally investigating Trump’s involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection and handling of classified documents in the Mar-a-Lago cases. Garland’s DOJ even wrote: “Under the Westfall Act, even conduct involving ‘serious criminality,’ or which runs ‘contrary to the national security of the United States,’ may fall within the scope of employment.” That statement should be music to the ears of Trump’s legal teams.  A path out of this mess was outlined for Garland in the Carroll legal team’s letter to the judge requesting to amend the complaint to use Trump’s CNN town hall remarks as a further basis for damages against the former president. In the letter, Carroll’s lead attorney, Robbie Kaplan, referenced DOJ's request that had the judge first rule on whether Carroll will be allowed to amend her complaint, in which case the DOJ would want 60 days to consider such evidence as Trump’s deposition used in Carroll II (as well as other evidence) before they submitted further legal briefings about whether Trump would be immune from the suit.  DOJ’s request signals that it is aware that Trump’s deposition—the one in which he doubled down on his Access Hollywood assertions that he was entitled as a star to grope women—may bear upon whether Trump’s insults of Carroll were truly within the scope of his duties as President of the United States. Close examination of the deposition could cause the DOJ to reconsider its position.  As Carroll’s team points out in its legal filings, the deposition shows that Trump appeared to act purely in his personal capacity in his derision of Carroll. Specifically, the deposition notes that at the time of the statements “neither Trump nor (to his knowledge) any of his White House aides had conducted any research or investigation” into Carroll, and Trump also failed to “identify any White House personnel as involved in investigating, preparing, strategizing, or preparing his June 2019 statements, or any official meetings focused on Carroll’s allegations.”  In other words, Trump’s insults and potentially defamatory denials had nothing to do with being president. It was all him.  Garland needs to consider and acknowledge this and get the DOJ out of the business of defending Trump. Stopping his embarrassing defense of Trump’s insulting of a sexual assault survivor would go a long way toward restoring the DOJ’s tarnished image. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nE.

        "text": "© Provided by LGBTQNation The debate about a prosaic bill to update language in Illinois law got heated when a Republican started ranting about furries.  A Republican lawmaker in Illinois cited the myth that students are dressing up as animals and using litterboxes in school instead of toilets while ranting against a bill he opposed that had nothing to do with school policy.  At issue is Illinois H.B. 1596, which would update some language in state family law. This includes changing the phrase “he or she” (or sometimes even just “he”) to something like “the minor” or “they,” referring to parents instead of “mother” and “father” and siblings instead of “sister and “brother,” and updating references to other laws. The ACLU of Illinois has praised the bill, saying it’s a step towards meeting “the needs of the growing number of LGBTQ+ youth under [the Department of Children and Family Services’s] care.”  But one person really doesn’t like the bill: state Sen. Andrew Chesney (R), who argued that the bill would confuse children. The bill changes language in the state’s legal code, something that children are unlikely to read.  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  “Folks, if you want to know why kids are confused and why people do crazy stuff, this is exactly why,” he said during a floor debate last Thursday.  “Biological males cannot get Pap smears. It’s not possible. It is physically and anatomally [sic] impossible. It is not even following science,” he continued.  “Biological women cannot go get a prostate exam. It is not possible.”  He admitted that he believes that student-furries are using litterboxes in schools, a myth that school districts across the country – and in Canada – have had to spend the last several years combatting.  “We can do all the gender feel-good garbage, but this is why your kids are confused. This is why your kids are dressing up as furries and kitty litter is in their bathrooms,” he said as several members of the state house started laughing. “There are two genders! There are two genders possible! There’s not three, there’s not four, there’s two.”  Chesney’s claim about students identifying as cats and demanding litter boxes is a reference to a right-wing lie once shared by activist Lisa Hansen. Because Hansen opposed federal regulations allowing trans students to use school restrooms matching their gender identities, she claimed that students who identify as cats were allowed to use litter boxes in one school’s unisex restroom.  A Michigan school superintendent was forced to write an email to parents debunking the lie. Nevertheless, the lie has been repeated by right-wingers, including by Nebraska Sen. Bruce Bostelman (R). During a televised debate, Bostelman claimed that student “furries” were allowed to interact with teachers by meowing and barking. He also said that one student who was denied a litter box later defecated on a classroom floor. Bostelman later admitted that the story wasn’t true.  The urban legend gained steam in the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections with Republican Colorado gubernatorial candidate Heidi Ganahl publishing a list of 30 schools that she accused of accommodating students “identifyng as cats.” Many of the schools released statements contradicting her claim.  Bret Miles, the executive director of the Colorado Association of School Executives, noted at the time, “This vicious rumor – it’s been debunked how many times already? Now it’s out there again, in our governor’s race…. School districts are spending time chasing down storylines that were purely for political gain. They have nothing to do with what kids are experiencing at school, and it’s shock and awe. It’s just incredibly frustrating.”  Another Colorado Republican – Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) – also said that schools are allowing kids who identify as cats to use litterboxes.  “Durango is doing this,” Boebert said. “This is how extreme it is.”  “No, we don’t provide litter boxes; our children use bathrooms,” a spokesperson for the Durango School District in Colorado said.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThis article discusses a bill in Illinois that would update language in state family law to be more inclusive of LGBTQ+ youth.\nRepublican lawmaker Andrew Chesney opposed the bill, claiming it would confuse children and citing a right-wing lie that students are dressing up as animals and using litterboxes in school instead of toilets.\nThis lie has been debunked multiple times, but has been repeated by other Republican politicians, including Colorado gubernatorial candidate Heidi Ganahl and Rep.

        "text": "© Win McNamee/Getty Images Above, a photo of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has called for an end to financial support of McCarthy and the RNC in response to the debt limit deal.  Steve Bannon, the former Donald Trump adviser and prominent far-right media figure, has called for supporters to end their financial support of the Republican Party in the wake of the recent debt ceiling compromise.  After weeks of back-and-forth debate, President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week reached a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling just in time to avoid a historic default. While the deal successfully passed in both the House and Senate, and was praised by many on the left for winning key compromises, it has nevertheless been met with negativity from both parties. Several Democrats have raised alarm over a provision in the bill that allowed a new oil pipeline to be fast-tracked, while many Republicans scoffed at how few of their demands were ultimately included.  Among the conservative voices decrying the bill is Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive and political strategist for Trump's first presidential campaign. During a recent segment of his War Room podcast, Bannon called for viewers to \"close their checkbooks\" and stop financially supporting McCarthy and the Republican National Committee (RNC) over their handling of the debt limit debate.  \"Well I tell you what, everybody out there close your checkbooks,\" he said. \"Don't give any money to McCarthy. Don't give any money to the RNC. Because until they come forward and say, 'hey, what do you mean?' Why am I giving money if you're going to be weaker?\"  In addition to raising the debt ceiling of $31.5 trillion for another two years, the deal reportedly includes a cap on federal spending in 2024 and 2025, cuts in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the addition of certain work requirements for food aid programs, though to a notable lesser degree than many Republicans had called for. The deal will keep the debt ceiling raised through January 2025, which many on the left have hailed as a win for Biden, as it will prevent another debt ceiling showdown next year as the 2024 presidential race heats up.  In a statement to Newsweek, Bannon previously called the deal \"dead on arrival\" and a \"total surrender\" for McCarthy, adding that he ought to face a challenge to his speakership over it and that Republicans who support it should face primary challenges.  \"This bill almost guarantees you $4 trillion with no cuts. It's dead on arrival. Any Republican that votes for this—they should primary them because this is nothing but a set of small optics compared to the real problem,\" Bannon said. \"The problem is that this exacerbates the debt problem because it takes off any limits to what can be added to the debt ceiling. There's no number, and we know it's for two years.\"  Newsweek reached out to McCarthy's press team via email for comment.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  Canada cannot be allowed to join the AUKUS nuclear submarine accord.  That agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States will establish a nuclear submarine force for Australia. It also facilitates cooperative high-tech research. AUKUS's underlying purpose is to boost Western defense capabilities in the face of China's threat. The Globe and Mail reported on Monday that Justin Trudeau's government wants to become AUKUS's newest member. Asked about that possibility, Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand stated that \"Canada is highly interested in furthering cooperation on AI, quantum computing, and other advanced technologies with a defense nexus with our closest allies. Our ties with our Five Eyes allies are strong, and indeed we remain interested in furthering cooperation in AI and other innovation efforts with our allies.\"  XI'S WAR ON ECONOMIC REALITY  It sounds good. Unfortunately, while Canada's CSIS and CSE intelligence services are well-regarded by their U.S., U.K., and Australian counterparts, Trudeau's government is a weak link on China.  It's likely that Canada wants to join AUKUS for two reasons that have little to do with China — namely, to access economically valuable technologies and to benefit from the diplomatic prestige that participation would entail. But Trudeau doesn't deserve that opportunity.  This represents a shift from the situation under the Trump administration. Back then, Trudeau was still willing to confront Chinese challenges to the democratic international order. No longer. Just last week, Trudeau again showed his unwillingness to resist China's attacks on democratic security.  The issue arose when The Globe and Mail, and notably not Trudeau's government, reported that Beijing had targeted a Canadian parliamentarian's family after he criticized China's human rights record. Trudeau did nothing until news of this outrage became public. Trudeau then equivocated for days. Only on Monday did Canada finally expel a Chinese diplomat. It's clear that Beijing senses weakness. In announcing the retaliatory expulsion of Canada's Consul General in Shanghai, a higher-ranking diplomat than the diplomat Canada expelled, the Chinese foreign ministry didn't hold back on Tuesday.  \"China never interferes in other countries’ internal affairs,\" a spokesperson said. \"The interference claims about China are unfounded. They are ideology and politically driven manipulation designed to slander and denigrate China.\"  The spokesperson concluded, \"We urge Canada to stop its provocation at once. If Canada decides to continue its wanton act, China will react firmly and all consequences arising therefrom must be borne by Canada.\"  Does this seem like the rhetoric of a government that is concerned it has been caught targeting the primary democratic institution of a G-7 power? Give me a break.  Trudeau's Canada is no longer a reliable U.S. ally. Alongside New Zealand, Canada's current government makes it a weak link in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. This weakness isn't simply measured by Trudeau's policy toward China — it also takes root in his disdain for burden-sharing. While the U.S. has concerns over the U.K. and Australia's resolve in the face of Chinese threats, those nations are at least boosting their respective military capabilities. Canada is doing nothing of the sort. And don't take my word for it — take that of the Canadian defense minister.  Canada is one of the lowest defense-spending members of NATO, allocating nowhere near the alliance's 2%-of-GDP minimum spending target. As the security analyst Patrick Fox observed, this neglect lends a special arrogance to Canada's request that it now be trusted to join AUKUS. Last year, however, defense minister Anand claimed that she would present \"aggressive options\" to boost defense spending toward the 2% target. But when the latest budget was unveiled in March, the numbers testified to a different reality. Canada's defense spending is likely to see further trimming, even in critical areas such as procurement.  This is not what serious allies do.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  Some disagree. Thomas Juneau, a professor at Ottawa University, told The Guardian that Canada is \"not going to be brought into these groups just because we’re a traditional ally; we’re going to be brought into these groups because we can make the case that we have something to contribute, which in some cases, is a case that we can make.\"  That's wishful thinking. Canada has neither earned AUKUS engagement nor provided the confidence that its inclusion would offer more benefits than risks. Until the Canadian government takes its alliance commitments more seriously, it cannot be allowed to participate in this important agreement.

        "text": "WASHINGTON − The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request from gun rights groups to temporarily block laws in Illinois that ban the sale of certain semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines, meaning the prohibitions will remain in effect for now.  The court turned down the request from gun groups in a one-sentence order that did not explain its reasoning, which is common for cases on its emergency docket. There were no noted dissents.  The decision, which is preliminary, is the latest in which the high court declined to intervene in a Second Amendment challenge following its decision last year to expand the ability of Americans to carry handguns in public. The type of weapons banned have been used in several mass shootings, including one outside of Chicago in July in which seven people were killed and dozens more were injured.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  Illinois enacted a law in January banning the sale of AR-15 rifles and handgun magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. Gun rights groups and a gun shop owner sued over that law as well as a similar ordinance enacted in Naperville, Ill., last year that bans the sale of \"assault rifles.\"  Gun rights groups cite a major opinion from the Supreme Court last year that declared a New York law requiring residents to have \"proper cause\" to carry a handgun unconstitutional. That 6-3 decision also directed courts to strike down gun regulations unless they are \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.\"  Why both sides cited history to frame the guns rights fight in Illinois  The decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen last year has opened a nationwide debate about what sort of gun regulations have a historic antecedent strong enough to clear that standard. Both sides in the Illinois dispute claim to have history on their side.  The state has \"been unable to identify a founding era regulation analogous to their absolute bans,\" the gun groups argued. \"The Second Amendment protects arms that are commonly possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, especially self-defense in the home.”  History: Can New Yorkers carry guns? A 700-year-old law may inform Supreme Court's Second Amendment decision  New standard: Supreme Court's Second Amendment decision demands courts look to history, tradition  Illinois officials told the Supreme Court this week that there is a tradition for banning certain types of weapons.  “Not only do assault weapons and (large capacity magazines) derive from military-grade weaponry, their features render them uniquely suitable as weapons of war but not commonly used or suitable for personal self-defense,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, a Democrat, told the court in a brief.  What happens now?  The case arrived on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, where the court often makes decisions about whether to temporarily allow or halt enforcement of laws while the underlying dispute plays out in lower federal courts. A U.S. District Court ruled for the city and state in February. In April, the Chicago-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit denied a request to temporarily block the laws while that decision is appealed.  The litigation will now continue in the appeals court and will likely eventually make it back to the Supreme Court on the merits.  The case is National Association for Gun Rights v. City of Naperville.  The Supreme Court’s decision last year in didn’t directly answer whether prohibitions on certain semi-automatic rifles, high-capacity magazines or people under 21 carrying weapons are consistent with the Second Amendment. There is also litigation pending about place-based prohibitions – such as in parks or on subways and buses.

        "text": "Â© Provided by 1945 Submarine  The Soviet Union once thought it had an edge over the United States in undersea warfare during the height of the Cold War. The Russians designed their Lira-class boats with titanium hulls that would allow the submarines to be better propelled and dive faster, deeper, and quieter. They could maybe even outfox incoming American and NATO torpedoes. The U.S. Navy never followed suit as the titanium hulls were more expensive and more challenging to build. Letâs take a closer look at the pros and cons of titanium subs to see if the navy made a good choice to pass or if it made a bad mistake.  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  Could This Be the Soviet Sub That Would Dominate the Americans?  The Soviet Project 705 âLiraâ (also called the Alfa) nuclear submarine was state of the art in the 1960s. It was going to reach speeds previously unattainable and be the quietest sub in the Russian navy. Titanium would be used for Lira hulls and a new lead-cooled reactor would power the ship to allow it to dive and turn quickly. The Lira-class was the fastest submarine ever built â able to reach 41 knots. It could quickly attain that speed and adroitly switch directions when needed.  Titanium Had Many Advantages  Titanium alloy is usually stronger than steel but weighs half as less. It is more expensive, up to three to five times more than steel. Titanium is also less corrosive in salt water. It can handle more pressure during deeper dives â all the way down to 2,200 feet. Fashioning titanium to make a hull is no easy feat. Welding is difficult and the slightest mistake during the welding phase could make the titanium brittle and less strong. Welders did their jobs in expensive facilities that had argon gas, making for dangerous work.  But Not Enough Pluses for the U.S. Navy  The United States was aware of the power, speed, and stealth of the Lira-class and took a close look at the titanium construction. Titanium is rare and costly compared to iron. Titanium is not easy to shape either. Welders would need an outside oxygen source during the workday. Any mis-step by the welders would create a sub that would be dangerous to take on deep dives. The higher pressure could compromise the weakened hull.  Just Build Better Torpedoes and Other Weapons for Undersea Combat  The U.S. Navy considered creating their own supply chain for titanium and determined the effort and cost would not be worth it. Instead, it looked to improve on undersea warfare capabilities instead of opting for a titanium made hull. The navy developed the MK 48 heavyweight torpedo that would take care of the Lira boats by going 63 knots. The British made a high-speed torpedo called the Spearfish. The Americans also started work on the Sea Lance anti-submarine missile that could carry a torpedo or depth charge to wreck a Lira-class.  Not as Dominant as Thought  The Soviets only produced seven Lira submarines. They had a complicated reactor that made repairs challenging. The titanium proved problematic as some boats experienced hull cracking creating costly and challenging fixes. The Liras were also not as quiet as the Soviets hoped even though the titanium was believed to be paramagnetic that would create a quieter ride. Despite being costly to maintain, they stayed in service until the end of the Cold War but were then decommissioned and scrapped.  The U.S. Navy Made the Right Decision  The U.S. Navy then made a good choice not to pursue titanium boats. The material is expensive and complicated to work with. Sometimes when pondering new designs in defense acquisition it is better to let your adversary jump out ahead and see where the weaknesses are and figure out the best way to counteract the advantages. The Russian boats were fast because of the titanium but they were not as quiet as advertised. The Americans felt that titanium was not worth the trouble and cost.

        "text": "Vivek Ramaswamy, the youngest 2024 Republican presidential candidate and self-proclaimed political outsider, on Sunday made his \"America first\" pitch for the White House while defending his view that the U.S. must force \"major concessions\" from Ukraine in order to end Russia's invasion and allow a sharper focus on facing China.  \"The job of the U.S. president is to look after American interests,\" he told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, arguing that militarily backing Ukraine's continued resistance to Russia's invasion is a less compelling goal than dealing with Beijing.  Ramaswamy's position on Ukraine and Russia puts him in the minority among politicians, with leading Republicans and Democrats saying Russia's invasion must not be successful in order to preserve stability in Europe.  \"You said in a speech in New Hampshire on Friday that you would not spend another dime of American money on a war that does not affect our interests. You don't think the possibility of Russia taking over Ukraine is in our interest?\" Raddatz asked him on \"This Week.\"  \"I don't think that's a top foreign policy priority,\" Ramaswamy said, later adding, \"I don't think it is preferable for Russia to be able to invade a sovereign country that is its neighbor. But ... I think the No. 1 threat to the U.S. military is right now, our top military threat, is the China-Russian alliance. I think that by fighting further in Russia, by further arming Ukraine, we are driving Russia into China's hands.\"  Instead, he said, he would \"end this war\" as long as Putin ended his country's alliance with China.  \"No one tells Vladimir Putin what to do. That has not worked yet,\" Raddatz pressed. \"And you said you would want to give them the Donbas [a region of Ukraine currently occupied by Russia]. ... That would be rewarding Putin, wouldn't it?\"  \"I don't trust Putin, but I do trust Putin to follow his self-interest,\" Ramaswamy maintained.  © Paul Beaty/AP, FILE FILE - Republican Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy speaks during a town hall meeting on the south side of Chicago, May 19, 2023.  \"What I think we need to do is end the Ukraine war on peaceful terms that, yes, do make some major concessions to Russia, including freezing those current lines of control in a Korean-war style armistice agreement. ... Which Ukraine wouldn't want to do,\" he continued. \"And also a permanent commitment not to allow Ukraine to enter NATO. But in return, Russia has to leave its treaty and its joint military agreement with China.\"  Ramaswamy raised concerns of a future invasion of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing views as a breakaway province.  Stopping a war there \"is a much higher priority,\" he said.  \"China's bet is that they're going to go for Taiwan, the U.S. won't want to be in simultaneous conflict with two nuclear superpowers at the same time. But if Russia's no longer at China's back and vice versa, we're in a stronger position,\" he said.  Early in Ramaswamy's \"This Week\" interview, Raddatz noted that he is polling in the back of the pack of GOP hopefuls and asked him on how he would walk the \"fine line\" of appealing to former President Donald Trump's base, who make up a large number of Republican primary voters.  \"America first does not belong to Trump. It doesn't belong to me,\" said Ramaswamy, a former biotech entrepreneur. \"It belongs to the people of this country. And I think we take that agenda even further if we're doing it based on first principles and moral authority, as [Ronald] Reagan did, rather than on vengeance and grievance.\"  No revival of Trump's trans military ban  In light of his criticism of \"woke\" policies around identity, diversity and historical oppression, Ramaswamy was asked by Raddatz if, as president, he would revive a controversial Trump-era ban on transgender military members that was reversed under President Joe Biden.  \"I would not reinstate a ban on transgender members,\" Ramaswamy said. \"I would, however, be very clear that for kids, that's where my policies are very focused.\"  Conservatives have increasingly called out policies around transgender children that they view as concerning, including pushing for limits on the health care that those kids can receive related to their gender, arguing they are extreme, which advocates and many doctors reject.  \"We should not be forcing this ideology onto children,\" Ramaswamy said.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nVivek Ramaswamy, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate, made his \"America first\" pitch for the White House while defending his view that the U.S. must force \"major concessions\" from Ukraine in order to end Russia's invasion and focus on facing China.\nHe argued that militarily backing Ukraine's resistance to Russia's invasion is a less compelling goal than dealing with Beijing.\nHe also said he would not revive the Trump-era ban on transgender military members, but would be \"very clear\" that his policies are focused on children.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nVivek Ramaswamy is a 2024 Republican presidential candidate advocating an \"America first\" approach.\nHe believes the US should force \"major concessions\" from Ukraine in order to end Russia's invasion and focus on facing China.\nHe would end the Ukraine war if Putin ends his country's alliance with China.\nHe would not revive the Trump-era ban on transgender military members, but would be \"very clear\" on policies around transgender children."

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  The Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Act was passed by Congress in 2018 to focus national resources and attention on genocidal conflicts around the world. My father survived the Holocaust and made it his life’s work to give voice to the voiceless. From Kosovo to Rwanda to Darfur, he fought oppression tirelessly.  Last week, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) weaponized the Elie Wiesel Genocide Act against Israel. The text of her proposed bill claims that Israeli aggression is the root cause of the issues that divide Israel and the Palestinian people today. It further suggests that Israel is subjecting the Palestinian people to an ongoing genocide. Democratic leaders who truly believe in the values my father stood for should speak out forcefully against this cynical accusation.  Genocide is the intended destruction, in whole or in part, of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. To suggest that Israel must be monitored lest it effect a genocide against Palestinians or their culture is an affront not only to decency but to the 6 million victims of the Holocaust, the 3 million Cambodians murdered by the Khmer Rouge, and to the million Tutsis killed in Rwanda.  Do genocidal regimes repeatedly offer territory for peace? Do nations committing atrocities drop leaflets or send text messages warning nearby civilians before they fire rockets at terrorist cells? Did 4 million Muslims not just observe Ramadan at Al-Aqsa last month in Jerusalem?  These false charges of genocide against Israel are smears long used by critics who apply classical anti-Semitic tropes to the Jewish state. And they have consequences. These forms of blood libel fan the flames of hatred towards Jews as surely as the medieval claims once did that we murdered Jesus or were killing Christian infants. To utilize my father’s name in such vile accusations is so far beyond the pale that I am staggered by the silence in response.  I cannot figure out why some within the progressive movement are so unfailingly obsessed with attacking Israel, to the point that prominent politicians such as Jeremy Corbyn nearly brought Britain’s Labor Party down over it. Why would they do this, when it distracts their energy from causes that are worthy and which they might just win?  I remember my father telling me: We have always been hated.  The root cause of the conflict is not Israel’s aggression. It is Israel’s existence. It is our existence.  Rabbi Leo Dee lost his wife and two daughters last month to cold-blooded murderers. He spoke recently about his desire to understand their killers. “I want to meet the parents and siblings of the terrorists and ask them two questions: What did they think they would accomplish with what they did and what is their vision for the future — what do they want for their grandchildren?”  The mother of one of the terrorists gave her answer in a televised interview. “Praise be to Allah for granting him [martyrdom]. We should fight them with our children, with our money, with our families, with our fingernails. We should devour the Jews with our teeth.”  We know what it means to be devoured.  This week, almost 80 years ago, my family boarded the transports to Auschwitz. They posed no military or other threat to the Nazis. Those who can work, to the left. Old, infirm and children to the right. And my aunt, grandmother, and great-grandparents were gone.  The Elie Wiesel Genocide Act is needed now more than ever. No help has come yet for the Rohingya in Myanmar. And it will take incredible community building by Americans of all faiths and parties to advocate effectively for the Chinese Communist Party to turn away from genocide against the 1 million Muslim Uyghurs estimated to be imprisoned in concentration camps in Xinjiang.  My father spoke for those who had no voice. Now my father is gone, and his life’s work is being obscenely, needlessly cheapened, distracting from the real work ahead of us.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), and all members of Congress who respect the beliefs my father stood for: my father is no longer here to thank you, but gratitude was one of his core values.  Thank you for defending Holocaust memory, and thank you for standing with the Jewish State of Israel, when both are attacked by activist members within your own party. Thank you for letting the world know the United States stands firmly against genocide now and forever. And in so doing, thank you for defending his name.

        "text": "The University of Georgia’s football team has turned down an invitation to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House, and people are crazy mad. Or they’re very happy.  They’re happy if they think Joe Biden is the second coming of Satan. If they think Joe Biden is ruining America. Or if they just hit up the ole MAGA shop for a new red ball cap and matching Rambo Trump flag.  © Provided by CNN Jeff Pearlman - Courtesy Paul Olkowski  They’re mad if they think Joe Biden is bringing America back. Or if they think the current administration is keeping democracy alive. Or if they find it disrespectful of the office. This stuff is all the talk on social media. “Bravo, Bulldogs!” “Damn you, Bulldogs!”  The Athens Banner-Herald reported that the team, in a statement on Tuesday, cited a scheduling conflict.  “Unfortunately, the date suggested is not feasible given the student-athlete calendar and time of year. However, we are appreciative of the invitation and look forward to other opportunities for Georgia teams moving forward,” read the statement published by the Banner-Herald.  The statement gave no indication of what prevented them from being able to travel to Washington, although Bulldogs head coach Kirby Smart insisted this week that there was “nothing political” in the decision.  Georgia players and fans have criticized the White House for not inviting the Bulldogs to meet with the president last year, when the team won the first of two successive national championships. (Covid protocols kept the White House from extending an invitation last year.)  In February, defensive lineman Warren Brinson expressed displeasure on Twitter that the team still had not received a White House invitation, a month after winning their second successive national championship.  “No invite to the White House is crazy,” Brinson wrote, tagging Biden’s @POTUS handle in the tweet. According to People Magazine, Georgia lawmakers petitioned the President weeks ago about extending an invitation to the team, which was sent by the White House earlier this week.  The truth is, the whole sports-team-visits-White House ritual should probably be retired. Sadly, we – the people – can no longer handle it. We are too immature and too divided.  Once upon a time, winning a title and meeting with the president meant something. The first time it happened was way back on Sept. 28, 1925, when the American League-champion Washington Senators made the short trek from Griffith Stadium to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to hang with Calvin Coolidge.  Though hardly a baseball fan, the 30th American president walked the line, shaking hands with each man, then posing for a photo. There was no media pile-on ripping Senator stars Walter Johnson and Goose Goslin for hanging with the Republican president. Instead, they simply reported and wrote up the story. They did their job, without the overt political biases we now slather ourselves in.  Some four decades later, the Boston Celtics became the first NBA championship team to hit up the White House following a title, and every single player gladly sat in the presence of John F. Kennedy, sipping tea and coffee, munching on snacks, chatting about Bill Russell’s defense and Bob Cousy’s ball handling. Were there Celtics who had voted for Richard Nixon in the 1960 election? Probably. Did it come up? No.  Truth be told, the White House-visit-as-a-championship-perk was going strong until 1993, when Tom Lehman, an American golfer, celebrated a Ryder Cup triumph by rejecting an offer to meet then-president Bill Clinton.  According to the website Sports on Earth, Lehman referred to America’s 42nd commander in chief as a “draft-dodging baby killer.” Four years later, Packers tight end Mark Chmura – a born-again Christian who opposed Clinton’s behavior – also declined a chance to be in the presence of Clinton after his team’s Super Bowl triumph.  In the two-and-a-half decades that have followed, more and more sports heroes have refused to take a day and shake hands with the president. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady cited a family commitment in 2015 when he declined a Barack Obama meet-up. So did NASCAR stars Greg Biffle, Carl Edwards, Kevin Harvick and Tony Stewart.  During the Trump years, an endless conga line of jocks said thanks-but-no thanks to the requisite Rose Garden photo op. And when athletes did attend, they were often pelted with online hostilities and furor. After the World Series champion Chicago Cubs stopped by in 2017, the story was not about the fruition of an American dream, but whether outfielder Albert Almora – as rumored – flipped off the president.  More recently, first lady Jill Biden made headlines with a wrongheaded suggestion that the women’s basketball teams from both Louisiana State University and the University of Iowa come to the White House after the LSU Tigers captured the NCAA crown. Reaction to the idea of extending twin invitations did not go well.  When the dust cleared, no invitation was extended to the losing team, but the PR damage was done. LSU meanwhile, is due to make its visit to the White House later this month.  Like our nation, which often feels broken to the point of disrepair, the sports team-visits-the-White House no longer works. We have stopped viewing the president as a representative of our nation. He is now a personal barometer—if you voted for Biden, you dig him. If you voted against him, you loathe him. There are no in-betweens. No subtleties.  Sports don’t need that. Sports teams don’t need that. We hit up a stadium or an arena to feel good. To scream, to cheer, to watch the spectacular and to embrace the bliss.  Sports give us simple pleasures in a complicated world. Politics, on the other hand, sucks the joy out. It makes us mean and petty and stupid. It is cruel. It is nasty.  The White House visit, once an honor, now feels like a burden.  We no longer can handle it.

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Hunter Biden  The New York Post has a new article relating to their very own coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. According to The Post, “the ex-CIA chief who wrote the letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials attempting to discredit The Post’s report on Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop told another former to intelligence official that he was drafting it as a “talking point” for Joe Biden to use during a debate with President Donald Trump.”  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  The ex-CIA chief in question is Michael Morell, who sent an email to another former CIA chief, John Brennan, in October of 2020 stating that Morell wanted to give Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign a little extra info to “push back on Trump.”  In the email, Morell was urging Brennan to sign the letter that Morell had written. “Can I add your name to this list?” Morell asked. “Trying to give the campaign, particularly during the debate on , a talking point to push back on Trump on this issue.”  The email also included a list of people Morell was working to recruit as signees. “Will be adding Leon, Sue Gordon, Jeh Johnson, George, Lisa Monaco, and Mike Rogers (DIRNSA) today. And working on adding Dan Coats, Mike Rogers (HPSCI) and Tom Bossert.”  Brennan replied “Ok, Michael, add my name to the list. Good initiative. Thanks for asking me to sign on.”  Not everyone signed the letter, of course. Daniel Hoffman, the CIA’s former Moscow station chief, told Fox News that he declined signing the letter because there was “no evidence” of Russian involvement in the Biden laptop scandal.  “It was not up to us to speculate,” Hoffman said. “So I didn’t sign the letter. I typically don’t put my name to other people’s words.”  The New York Post is justified in their indignation  The Post has good reason to be irritated; they broke a legitimate story – that Hunter Biden’s laptop, which had been abandoned at a Delaware computer shop, revealed emails implicating then-presidential candidate Joe Biden in corruption. The story was quickly dismissed, however, as being a product of Russian disinformation. The mainstream media – and the intelligence community (as represented in Morell’s letter) – banded together to denounce the laptop story.  But the story was real. It wasn’t Russian disinformation at all. Hunter Biden’s laptop had been abandoned at a Delaware computer shop, and the laptop’s emails were recovered. How significant the emails were, whether they really implicated Joe Biden in corruption or not, isn’t the point, as the meaning of significance is debatable. What’s not debatable is that the computer and the emails were authentic.  That such powerful entities collaborated to convince the public, weeks before a presidential election, that the story was a lie is the most concerning element of this whole thing. Ironically, the effort to dismiss the laptop story as disinformation was itself disinformation. And disinformation is of course what the left has been decrying for years as a corrosive agent nibbling at the edges of democracy.  What The Post disinformation scandal demonstrates is that information and truth is malleable and that both sides seem willing to manipulate the facts and the optics surrounding the facts to meet their own political needs. And I don’t mean for that to come off as a Don’t Trust the Media or a Don’t Trust the Government sort of message. But just bear in mind that no one has a monopoly on the truth.

        "text": "© Provided by The Associated Press File - Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, center, arrives at federal court with her father, Christian Holmes IV, left, and partner, Billy Evans, in San Jose, Calif., Monday, Oct. 17, 2022. As Elizabeth Holmes prepares to report to prison next week, the criminal case that laid bare the blood-testing scam at the heart of her Theranos startup is entering its final phase. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — As Elizabeth Holmes prepares to report to prison next week, the criminal case that laid bare the blood-testing scam at the heart of her Theranos startup is entering its final phase. The 11-year sentence represents a comeuppance for the wide-eyed woman who broke through “tech bro” culture to become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated entrepreneurs, only to be exposed as a fraud. Along the way, Holmes became a symbol of the shameless hyperbole that often saturates startup culture. But questions still linger about her true intentions — so many that even the federal judge who presided over her trial seemed mystified. And Holmes' defenders continue to ask whether the punishment fits the crime. At 39, she seems most likely to be remembered as Silicon Valley’s Icarus — a high-flying entrepreneur burning with reckless ambition whose odyssey culminated in convictions for fraud and conspiracy. Her motives are still somewhat mysterious, and some supporters say federal prosecutors targeted her unfairly in their zeal to bring down one of the most prominent practitioners of fake-it-til-you-make-it — the tech sector's brand of self-promotion that sometimes veers into exaggeration and blatant lies to raise money. Holmes will begin to pay the price for her deceit on May 30 when she is scheduled begin the sentence that will separate her from her two children — a son whose July 2021 birth delayed the start of her trial and a 3-month-old daughter conceived after her conviction. She is expected to be incarcerated in Bryan, Texas, about 100 miles (160 km) northwest of her hometown of Houston. The prison was recommended by the judge who sentenced Holmes, but authorities have not publicly disclosed where she will be held. Her many detractors contend she deserves to be in prison for peddling a technology that she repeatedly boasted would quickly scan for hundreds of diseases and other health problems with a few drops of blood taken with a finger prick. The technology never worked as promised. Instead, Theranos tests produced wildly unreliable results that could have endangered patients' lives — one of the most frequently cited reasons why she deserved to be prosecuted. Before those lies were uncovered in a series of explosive articles in The Wall Street Journal beginning in October 2015, Holmes raised nearly $1 billion from a list of savvy investors including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and media mogul Rupert Murdoch. It was the duping of those investors that led to her prison sentence and a $452 million restitution bill. Holmes' stake in Theranos at one point catapulted her paper wealth to $4.5 billion. She never sold any of her stock in the company, though trial evidence left no doubt she reveled in the trappings of fame and fortune — so much so that she and the father of her children, William “Billy” Evans, lived on a palatial Silicon Valley estate during the trial. The theory that Holmes was running an elaborate scam was buttressed by trial evidence documenting her efforts to prevent the Journal's investigation from being published. That campaign compelled John Carreyrou — the reporter responsible for those bombshell stories — to attend court and position himself in Holmes' line of vision when she took the witness stand. © Provided by The Associated Press FILE - Elizabeth Holmes, then the CEO of Theranos, speaks at the Fortune Global Forum on Nov. 2, 2015 in San Francisco. As Holmes prepares to report to prison next week, the criminal case that laid bare the blood-testing scam at the heart of her Theranos startup is entering its final phase.(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Holmes also signed off on surveillance aimed at intimidating Theranos employees who helped uncover the flaws with the blood-testing technology. The whistleblowers included Tyler Shultz, the grandson of former Secretary of State George Shultz, whom Holmes befriended and persuaded to join the Theranos board. Tyler Shultz became so unnerved by Holmes' efforts to shut him up that he began sleeping with a knife under his pillow, according to a wrenching statement delivered by his father, Alex, at her sentencing. Holmes' supporters still contend she always had good intentions and was unfairly scapegoated by the Justice Department. They insist she simply deployed the same over-the-top promotion tactics as many other tech executives, including Elon Musk, who has repeatedly made misleading statements about the capabilities of Tesla's self-driving cars. According to those supporters, Holmes was singled out because she was a woman who briefly eclipsed the men who customarily bask in Silicon Valley's spotlight, and the trial turned her into a latter-day version of Hester Prynne — the protagonist in the 1850 novel “The Scarlet Letter.” Holmes steadfastly maintained her innocence during seven often-riveting days of testimony in her own defense — a spectacle that caused people to line up shortly after midnight to secure one of the few dozen seats available in the San Jose courtroom. On one memorable day, Holmes recounted how she had never gotten over the trauma of being raped while enrolled at Stanford University. She then described being subjected to a long-running pattern of emotional and sexual abuse by her former lover and Theranos conspirator, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, and suggested his stifling control blurred her thinking. Balwani's lawyer, Jeffrey Coopersmith, denied those allegations during the trial. In Balwani's subsequent trial, Coopersmith unsuccessfully tried to depict his client as Holmes' pawn. Balwani, 57, is now serving a nearly 13-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy. When it came time to sentence the then-pregnant Holmes in November, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila seemed as puzzled as anyone about why she did what she did. ”This is a fraud case where an exciting venture went forward with great expectations and hope, only to be dashed by untruth, misrepresentations, hubris and plain lies,\" Davila lamented while Holmes stood before him. “I suppose we step back and we look at this, and we think what is the pathology of fraud?” The judge also hearkened back to the days that Silicon Valley consisted mostly of orchards farmed by immigrants. That was before the land was ceded to the tech boom beginning in 1939 when William Hewlett and David Packard founded a company bearing their surnames in a one-car garage in Palo Alto — the same city where Theranos was based. “You’ll recall the wonderful innovation of those two individuals in that small garage,” Davila reminded everyone in the rapt courtroom. “No exotic automobiles or lavish lifestyle, just a desire to create for society’s benefit through honest hard work. And that, I would hope, would be the continuing story, the legacy and practice of Silicon Valley.” ___ Michael Liedtke has been covering Silicon Valley for The Associated Press for 23 years.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nElizabeth Holmes, the former CEO of Theranos, is set to begin her 11-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy.\nHer technology, which promised to quickly scan for hundreds of diseases and other health problems with a few drops of blood, never worked as promised and could have endangered patients' lives.\nHolmes raised nearly $1 billion from investors before her lies were uncovered, and her supporters argue that she was unfairly targeted by federal prosecutors.\nThe judge presiding over her trial seemed mystified by her motives, and her supporters continue to ask whether the punishment fits the crime.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nElizabeth Holmes is set to begin her 11-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy related to her startup, Theranos. \nHolmes was accused of peddling a technology that never worked as promised and could have endangered patients' lives. \nHolmes raised nearly $1 billion from investors before her lies were uncovered. \nHolmes' supporters argue that she was unfairly targeted for her use of fake-it-til-you-make-it tactics."

Lukashenko struggled to complete the short walk and even missed a breakfast gathering organized by Putin.

        "text": "The difficult questions surrounding Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Republican megadonor Harlan Crow are not altogether new. The New York Times reported 12 years ago, for example, on the menâs âethically sensitive friendship,â and the fact that Crow had showered Thomas with lucrative gifts, including a generous check to the justiceâs wife to start a lobbying organization, despite the fact that Crowâs company had multiple cases in the federal court system.  But by any fair measure, those questions have become far more serious over the last month. ProPublica reported nearly a month ago on the extent to which the far-right jurist has spent the last couple of decades accepting gifts and luxury trips from Crow, which Thomas failed to disclose. The outlet ran a second report soon after, noting that the real estate magnate also bought property from Thomas, which the justice also failed to disclose.  The story grew even more serious with the latest ProPublica report, published this morning.  According to the report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, when the teenager attended a second boarding school, Crow picked up that tab, too. That also went undisclosed.  ProPublica added, âThe exact total Crow paid for Martinâs education over the years remains unclear. If he paid for all four years at the two schools, the price tag could have exceeded $150,000, according to public records of tuition rates at the schools.â  While Thomas hasnât yet commented on the latest revelations, Crow told the outlet thatâs âlong been passionate about the importance of quality education and giving back to those less fortunate, especially at-risk youth.â He called it âdisappointing that those with partisan political interests would try to turn helping at-risk youth with tuition assistance into something nefarious or political.â  Richard Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, didnât quite see it that way. Reflecting on his White House tenure, Painter said an official whoâd taken what Thomas had would have been fired. âThis amount of undisclosed gifts? Youâd want to get them out of the government,â he explained.  For their part, Thomasâ Republican allies continue to rally behind him, even as they struggle to come up with a cogent defenses. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, for example, argued via social media yesterday, âWhen this chapter of American history is written, those who attack Justice Thomas today will be justly dismissed as intolerant bigots.â  To the extent that reality still has any meaning, neither Lee nor any of his fellow Thomas supporters have discredited, debunked, or even contested a single detail from the justiceâs ongoing ethics mess. By all appearances, everything the public has learned about Thomas and Crow has been entirely accurate.  But weâre supposed to see the scrutiny as unfair and unwarranted because ... well, just because.  A reader yesterday told me about a worthwhile thought experiment. Letâs imagine if Justice Sonia Sotomayor struck up a friendship with a Democratic megadonor â perhaps someone like George Soros â after joining the Supreme Court. In time, as part of this entirely fictional scenario, the wealthy donor wrote a generous check to help a member of Sotomayorâs family start a lobbying organization.  In the years that followed, the megadonor â who had cases in the federal court system â spent decades providing Sotomayor with gifts and luxury trips, buying property from the justice, and even paying the private-school tuition for another member of Sotomayorâs family. The justice, for unstated reasons in this thought experiment, chose not to disclose any of this.  Would Republicans shrug their shoulders with indifference? If GOP lawmakers raised concerns, and Democrats â unable to challenge any of the substantive details â condemned them as âintolerant bigots,â would Republicans see such pushback as reasonable?  I donât think thereâs any great mystery about the answers. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe article discusses the ethically sensitive friendship between Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Republican megadonor Harlan Crow, and the fact that Crow has showered Thomas with gifts and luxury trips, which Thomas failed to disclose.\nProPublica reported that Crow also paid for the private-school tuition of a member of Thomas' family.\nRichard Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) was positively apoplectic in January when House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) denied him membership on the House Intelligence Committee he had led for the past four years.  In an interview with CNN at the time, congenital liar Schiff “tripled down” on the Russian collusion hoax. He wanted to “set the record straight.” He said, “If you read the Mueller report, he makes clear … that he states no conclusion on whether Donald Trump and his campaign colluded with the Russians.”  LIBERALS BLAME REPUBLICANS, NOT BIDEN, FOR THEIR PURSUIT OF DEBT CEILING 'PLAN B'  Separately, Schiff tweeted, “Kevin McCarthy just kicked me and @RepSwalwell off the Intelligence Committee. This is petty, political payback for investigating Donald Trump. If he thinks this will stop me, he will soon find out just how wrong he is. I will always defend our democracy.”  For more than three years, Schiff had been the face of the Democrats’ failed attempt to connect former President Donald Trump to the Russians. He arrived in Washington, D.C., in 2001 and remained obscure until he recognized his moment had come at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.  He quickly became a cheerleader for the Democrats’ narrative that the Russians had hacked the DNC’s computer to help Trump win the election. Happy to talk to any reporter, he soon became the “go-to guy” for anything related to the FBI's bogus investigation into the Trump campaign and the Mueller investigation that followed. Schiff was finally receiving the attention he’d craved for so long, and he clearly relished it. He never missed an opportunity to assure the public that evidence of Trump’s collusion with Russia was hiding in plain sight. He’d found his niche.  Crestfallen after the Mueller investigation came up empty-handed in the spring of 2019, he seized upon Trump’s July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his next act. Schiff’s deceitful, manipulative actions in using that call to impeach Trump could fill a book.  Although one could argue that it came way too late, the Durham report on the origins of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, released last week, was a damning indictment of the stunning abuses of power by the FBI and high-ranking government officials. Durham concluded there had been no predicate for the government's investigation of the Trump campaign and that it had been politically motivated.  Speaking to reporters about the report, McCarthy questioned Schiff’s fitness for office. He said, “If you're concerned about threats to our democracy, you are right to be angry over the coordinated campaign to lie to the American public for years about Russia collusion — peddled at the highest levels of government, from Adam Schiff to the DOJ — to try to influence an election.\"  He noted that the report “really raises the question about Adam Schiff. Remember when he told the American people he had proof? Remember when he told them he didn’t know the whistleblower? And what he put America through and openly lied to us?”  \"It raises a lot of questions about his character, his standing inside of Congress, or whether he should even be in Congress,” he added.  On Tuesday, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) submitted a resolution to expel Schiff from the House of Representatives. She posted the document on Twitter with the following message: “Knowingly using your position on House Intel to push a lie that ripped apart our country, cost taxpayers millions of dollars, and authorized spying on a US President and then proceeding to double down on the lie within days of the Durham report coming out makes you unfit for office. Ethics should investigate.”  The narrative that put this repellent man on the map in Washington, that Trump colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election, has now been thoroughly discredited.  Still, that hasn’t stopped him from trying to fail upward. He plans to run for the Senate seat currently occupied by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who is retiring. This corrupt man, who has so flagrantly abused his position of power, deserves to be expelled from Congress and shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the U.S. Senate.  But the wonder of it all is that Schiff still doesn’t seem to grasp the fact that the jig is up.

Components of Russian Kh-101 cruise missiles on display in Kyiv in February. Oleksii Chumachenko/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  Russia has been launching waves of drone and missile attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure.  To replenish its stocks of missiles and other weapons, Russia has scrambled to find more microchips.  The hunt for those vital components is a sign of what may await the US and China in a protracted war.  In October, after weeks of successful Ukrainian counterattacks, Russia changed its strategy and began a campaign of long-range airstrikes.  Using waves of exploding drones and salvos of ballistic and cruise missiles, Russia has sought to destroy Ukraine's power grid, overwhelm its military, and terrorize its population.  To date, the Russian military has launched thousands of missiles and drones against Ukrainian critical infrastructure and urban centers, killing and wounding hundreds of civilians.  But those strikes have depleted Russia's missile stocks, and Western sanctions are making it harder for Moscow to buy or make a small but critical component: microchips.  Russia's scramble to find microchips for its weapons hints at struggles the US and China could face in a future war.  Russian strikes and microchips  © Oleksii Chumachenko/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images A Ukrainian military official with electronics from a destroyed Russian T-90M tank in Kyiv in March.

Oleksii Chumachenko/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  Western-made microchips and processors power many of Russia's weapon systems, even its most advanced missiles and aircraft. For example, the Orlan-10, one of the Russian military's most widely used drones, is able to gather battlefield intelligence thanks to Western-made parts.  While Russia's supply of modern precision weapons is dwindling, it is still making missiles. Ukrainian military intelligence said late last year that Russian factories had produced 40 new missiles a month on average since the war started. That may allow for continued attacks, but it is likely too low to meaningfully support any large-scale Russian offensives.  Extensive sanctions imposed by Western countries since the war started have hamstrung Russia's weapons production. The situation has gotten so bad that Moscow has begun cannibalizing older weapons and even scavenging non-military hardware, such as fridges and dishwashers, for microchips that could go into missiles and other weapons.  That means that as the war drags on the Russian military will have fewer advanced weapons to fight a Ukrainian military that is receiving more advanced hardware from the West.  Russia's struggle to find microchips is also a warning in militaries around the world, especially the US and China.  Microchips, major tensions  © Yang Bo/China News Service via Getty Images A 300mm wafer used to produce semiconductors at the TSMC stand during a semiconductor conference in China in August 2020.

Yang Bo/China News Service via Getty Images  All advanced military hardware uses microchips, often in many ways, from communications to navigation to targeting and fire control. Despite the worldwide dependence on microchips, the market is extremely small, especially for the chips needed advanced precision weaponry.  To understand how exclusive the microchip market is, one has just to look at a relatively obscure Dutch company: Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography.  ASML is the only firm that produces extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography machines, which are needed to make advanced microchips. The machines cost as much as $200 million, and only a few firms can afford to buy them and produce highly advanced semiconductors, including Samsung in South Korea, Intel in the US, and TSMC in Taiwan.  TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, producing about 90% of the most advanced semiconductors and one-third of the new computing power produced each year, according to Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and author of \"Chip War.\"  A US-Chinese clash over Taiwan, or some other disruption, like a Chinese blockade, that halts exports of advanced semiconductors would affect numerous other industries. A protracted war between the US and China over Taiwan would worsen that impact, and both sides would likely face challenges in replacing their cutting-edge weapon systems and munitions as the available supply of microchips shrunk.  © BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images President Joe Biden tours the TSMC semiconductor manufacturing facility in Phoenix in December.

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images  \"In terms of a war or a blockade between China and Taiwan, the impact on not just the tech sector but all of manufacturing would be close to catastrophic,\" Miller said in a recent interview with The Verge.  \"It certainly would be catastrophic to Apple or to AMD if we were to lose access to TSMC's facilities, but it's also dishwashers, microwaves, and autos that would face tremendous disruptions,\" Miller added, describing a manufacturing crisis that would feel like the 1929 stock market crash \"in terms of its shock.\"  The US and its allies have sought to curtail China's ability to manufacture advanced semiconductors in order to restrict Beijing's artificial intelligence and defense ambitions.  The US, Japan, and the Netherlands agreed earlier this year to further limit export of chip manufacturing equipment to China and are seeking further restrictions. The US has also pledged to spend billions to encourage increased domestic production of microchips.  For its part, China has moved to bolster its own domestic chip industry and continue its technological development.  While tiny in size, microchips have become a major focus for advanced economies, which want to ensure their supplies so their industries can keep working and their militaries can keep fighting.

        "text": "Â© Provided by 1945 Joe Biden  Joe Biden Will Have to Divide America to Win in 2024: There is no denying that former President Donald Trump's policies have divided the United States of America. Trump knows that to win back the Oval Office, he'll have to maintain his divide-and-conquer strategy. Trump needs Americans â at least his base â to be outraged, angry, and concerned about the direction the country is headed.  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  It is a sad strategy for any candidate.  Unfortunately, the very same tactics are now being employed by President Joe Biden, who has suggested that the 2024 election will be a battle for the \"soul\" of the country. Hear these two guys talk, and if they lose there won't be an America anymore.  No doubt, too many Americans believe this to be true.  What is notable is that a lot of Biden voters seem to miss that this is his strategy. Yet, Joe Biden has never really claimed to be a unifier, and he certainly never tried to be one either. During his 2020 campaign, Biden proclaimed \"I'm running as a Democrat but I will govern as an American president.\"  It is a line that sounds great â until you give it some thought. Of course, he'd govern as an \"American,\" because that's what Biden is. What should we expect? That'd he govern as a Martian?  MAGA Republicans Are Now the Enemy  Fast forward, and the sitting president routinely casts those he opposes as \"MAGA Republicans,\" blaming them for any time he doesn't get his way.  For someone who has said we need to work together, it certainly seems not to be the case. As recently as last month, Biden has claimed MAGA Republicans are threatening to hurt the economy, TheHill.com reported.  \"Extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress, on the other hand, are threatening to wreak havoc on our economy with debt limit brinkmanship,\" Biden said in a statement.  It was hardly the first time he's gone on such an offensive.  Last September, Biden gave a speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, which has become known as the \"Continued Battle for the Soul of the Nation.\"  In that address, he said, \"Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election: either they win or they were cheated. And that's where MAGA Republicans are today.\"  Though it is true that too many Trump supporters â even today â fail to accept the outcome of the 2020 election, it should be remembered that supporters of Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, Stacey Abrams, and many others have taken very much the same case. They all lost, and they said not because they ran bad campaigns and not because the voters decided to pick someone else. It was because they were cheated, they claim.  Stacey Abrams became a liberal media darling because she failed to concede her 2018 loss.  Likewise, Hillary Clinton wrongly blamed her 2016 loss to Trump on a plethora of reasons that suggest it wasnât a fair election. But we must remember that even as she had famously labeled half of Trump's supporters as being in a \"basket of deplorable,\" she never went as far as Biden in demonizing so many Americans.  As noted, this is sadly where we are in America.  Fortunately, others of note see this problem. Last October, USA Today opinion columnist John Wood Jr. suggested, \"To heal America, we need a generosity and courage of spirit that is incompatible with the notion of 'total war' in our politics.\"  Again, Biden isnât alone in dividing America. But he shouldnât pretend to be a unifier.  Unfortunately, the two candidates likely to face off in next year's election each see half the country (anyone who doesn't vote for them in other words) as the enemy. That also explains why the majority of Americans don't want either of these men to run again.

When Howie came home that night after a 15-hour shift, he recounted an upsetting interaction with a protester he approached, thinking he needed assistance, only to be given a Nazi salute and shouted at in German. Howie was disgusted by the attack on an institution that meant so much to him, but this particular exchange, in the shadow of the Capitol, obviously bothered him.  Following his 15-hour shift, Howie got two hours of sleep before returning to work.  The next day, Jan. 7, after more than 11 hours into his shift, Howie’s police cruiser was involved in a collision that caused him to briefly lose consciousness. The required paperwork forced him to extend his shift to 15 hours, all while functioning on only two hours of sleep.  By Jan. 8, some of his colleagues noticed that he seemed tired and quieter than usual.  When he returned home on Jan. 9, after yet another 12-hour shift, he was distant. Normally ravenous after a shift, he barely touched his dinner.  He was scheduled to return the next day for another 12-hour shift, but he never made it. That night, he died by suicide using his service weapon.  Howie’s story isn’t unique. Law enforcement is a dangerous profession.

How healing trauma could actually reform policing  Police face significantly higher risk of suicide  Police officers face a 54% greater risk of suicide than the general population. Last year, 180 officers took their own lives, nearly three times the number shot and killed in the line of duty.  Repeated studies by the Ruderman Family Foundation found that police officers and firefighters are more likely to die by suicide than in all line-of-duty causes combined. Nevertheless, police departments are reluctant to talk about officer suicides, and only a few of them have suicide-prevention programs.  While the stresses are relentless, cops are supposed to be “tough.” The perceived stigma surrounding mental health problems, and the fear of being labeled “unfit for duty,” keeps many officers from seeking help.

Howie’s was the first death claim made pursuant to the newly enacted Public Safety Officer Support Act, which finally recognizes that in many cases, like Howie’s, law enforcement suicides are indeed service-connected and should be seen as what they are – deaths in the line of duty.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Capitol Police also officially recognized his death as being in the line of duty.  Nevertheless, the stigma surrounding police officer suicides is intractable – and dangerous.  Since 1984, for instance, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund has honored the names of fallen officers, but the memorial still does not include the names of officers, like Howie, who died by suicide in the line of duty.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy, attends an NCAA college basketball game Saturday, Jan. 22, 2022, in Coral Gables, Fla.  There are plenty of “woke” digital media. Then there’s Barstool Sports. The online content factory, which originally focused on sports but now does everything from entertainment to politics, was, from its inception, politically incorrect. Yet, evidently, even Barstool is no longer safe from the pernicious influence of cancel culture.  The company recently fired popular personality Ben Mintz in what can only be described as an injustice. During a livestream, the host was reading Bone Thugs-N-Harmony lyrics out in real time from his phone and failed to catch himself before repeating the N-word out loud. Mintz immediately realized his mistake and apologized profusely after the fact.  CLARENCE THOMAS PREDICTED CANCEL CULTURE LONG BEFORE IT CAME FOR HIM  “This morning, I made an unforgivable mistake slipping on air while reading a song lyric,” he said. “I meant no harm & have never felt worse about anything. I apologize for my actions. I am truly sorry & ashamed of myself.”  Even this groveling wasn’t enough to save Mintz in a culture as devoid of grace as ours. He was summarily dismissed, with the firing occurring against the wishes of top Barstool executives such as founder Dave Portnoy but being mandated by corporate owner Penn Entertainment, which purchased the company in full in February.  “I hate the decision,” Portnoy said. “I disagree with the decision. I would not have made the decision. But I don’t deal with the things Penn deals with in terms of state regulators, etc.”  In a video posted to social media, Portnoy explained the company is “highly regulated by the government” and relies on gambling licenses from various government authorities and, “just as easily as they’re issued, they can be pulled back.”  What differentiates this particular incident from other examples of cancel culture is that there wasn’t even any significant public demand for Mintz to face termination. You can find a few tweets expressing outrage, sure, but nowhere near the typical volume of backlash found in these instances. That’s right: Even in the hellscape of Twitter, a place typically devoid of nuance, most people seemed to realize that it was an innocent enough mistake, not some intentional act of racial bigotry.  Why? Well, perhaps because no one was actually harmed by this. No actual person’s life was materially worsened in any way by some fratty sports influencer reciting a lyric during a livestream. But one man’s career and life were just turned upside down for no apparent reason other than a graceless culture and corporate cowardice.  And make no mistake, Penn’s corporate excuse-making is simply cowardice. Leaders are essentially arguing they had to fire Mintz because this could jeopardize their ability to obtain gambling licenses from various state governments. That alone seems incredibly far-fetched.  But even if it were true, for a government to deny them a license on the basis of constitutionally protected free speech — yes, even slurs are protected by the First Amendment — would arguably be a violation of the First Amendment, and they’d have a case against that government in court. What’s more, any government that was going to hold this against them when considering licenses could still do so regardless of whether the employee was fired or not.  Even if Penn doesn’t want to take any risks because all it cares about is the bottom line, and its leaders don’t care about their employees or basic compassion or fairness, this is still the wrong call.  By caving to the cruelest form of cancel culture, they’re alienating Barstool’s core fan base and compromising everything its brand is supposed to represent. After all, you can’t be an irreverent, countercultural brand and also ax your employees for even the most minor transgressions of \"woke\" pieties. So it’s not exactly shocking that amid this controversy, Penn’s stock price has plummeted, and Barstool’s comment sections have flooded with denunciations from former supporters.  The backlash against Barstool is understandable, although it’s hard to fault the Barstool press too much, seeing as this came down from higher up against their protestations. But it sure does make Portnoy’s choice to sell the company to an openly “woke” corporation that embraces “ESG” look even worse in hindsight.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  When debt ceiling negotiations reached a fever pitch, President Biden made a crucial mistake. To steal a word coined by former President George W. Bush, he severely misunderestimated the strategic prowess of Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (Calif.).  In doing so, Biden inadvertently paved the way for McCarthy and the Republican Congress to achieve remarkable conservative victories that will have a lasting impact on the nation.  House Republicans’ shrewd maneuvering resulted in the largest reduction in spending in history — a rollback of nondefense spending to fiscal 2022 levels, the implementation of work requirements for government benefit programs and the successful clawback of billions in unspent funds from COVID-19 programs.  These accomplishments became possible even though Biden and his administration had maintained for months that they would never negotiate on the debt ceiling.  The debt ceiling negotiations were a battleground for ideological clashes between the two major parties. Biden, perhaps blinded by the initial success of his policy agenda under one-party rule and the bumpy process to kick off the most recent Congress, failed to recognize his adversary’s tactical acumen.  McCarthy, on the other hand, seized this opportunity to show the art of the possible and rally conservative forces and fight for a smaller, more fiscally responsible government when they passed the initial version of the Limit, Save, Grow Act. Although some compromise was inevitable, through strategic maneuvering, McCarthy was able to secure wins in the final bill that will ultimately resonate with conservative voters and shape the trajectory of our nation’s fiscal policy.  McCarthy just orchestrated the largest spending reduction in U.S. history, including substantial cuts across various sectors of government expenditure. This feat not only demonstrates Republican commitment to fiscal responsibility but also highlights his ability to galvanize support and achieve tangible results.  In addition to the historic spending reduction, House Republicans successfully rolled back nondefense spending to fiscal 2022 levels, reducing at least some of the inflation-causing spending that has plagued our nation. This move is a significant departure from the excessive government growth witnessed in recent years. By curbing nondefense spending, House Republicans have sent a clear message that the era of unchecked expansion and government waste is over.  Furthermore, implementation of work requirements for government benefit programs showcases Republican dedication to restoring a culture of individual responsibility. By encouraging able-bodied individuals to return to work rather than rely on government handouts, House Republicans are championing self-sufficiency and the dignity that comes with earned success. This conservative victory will not only alleviate the burden on taxpayers, but also empower individuals to take control of their own lives and contribute to the overall prosperity of the nation.  Finally, the success in clawing back billions of unspent funds from COVID programs highlights a commitment to fiscal accountability. McCarthy recognized the need to scrutinize the distribution and utilization of COVID funds and fought to reclaim unspent dollars. This action not only safeguards taxpayer money, but also ensures that these resources are allocated efficiently and effectively to address the ongoing challenges of the pandemic.  President Biden’s failure to fully comprehend McCarthy’s capabilities during the debt ceiling negotiations has had far-reaching consequences. These conservative victories have set a precedent for responsible fiscal governance, welfare reform and enhanced accountability. It is only a first step, but America is better off for McCarthy’s bold actions.  Matt Mowers is the former senior White House adviser in the U.S. Department of State under former President Trump.

George Santos, R-N.Y., arrives at the House Chamber, Thursday, May 11, 2023, at the Capitol in Washington, as House Republicans are on track to pass a sweeping bill to build more U.S.-Mexico border wall and impose new restrictions on asylum seekers. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats took steps Tuesday to force a vote on expelling New York Rep. George Santos from Congress, an effort that is expected to be defeated but puts Republicans in the uncomfortable position of taking a stand on an indicted colleague.  The freshman GOP congressman has been charged with embezzling money from his campaign, falsely receiving unemployment funds and lying to Congress about his finances. He has denied the charges and has pleaded not guilty.  Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., introduced a resolution in February to expel Santos, something the House has only done twice in recent decades and requires the approval of a two-thirds majority. He brought the measure Tuesday to the House floor under a process that gives lawmakers until Thursday to dispense with it.  Republicans could vote to table the effort. They could also refer it to the House Ethics Committee for consideration, which House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., indicated was his preferred route. Both efforts require a majority vote. Republicans could also just allow the House to vote on Garcia's expulsion resolution, but that is unlikely.  “I wanted him to resign. We gave him plenty of time to do it,\" Garcia said of his decision to bring the measure up this week. “His other Republican freshmen also want him to resign and it's time for him to go.\"  Santos, despite the federal charges he's facing, is moving forward with his plans to seek reelection and has defied calls for his resignation. “This is the beginning of the ability for me to address and defend myself,” Santos told reporters following his indictment. His office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Garcia's resolution.  © Provided by The Associated Press U.S. Rep. George Santos leaves the federal courthouse in Central Islip, N.Y., Wednesday, May 10, 2023. Santos pleaded not guilty to charges alleging a financial fraud at the heart of a political campaign built on dubious boasts about his personal wealth and business success. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)  Republican leaders have said Santos deserves to have his day in court before Congress weighs in. The position Republican leaders have staked out generally follows the precedent that Congress has set in similar criminal cases over the years. The House has expelled just two members in recent decades, and both votes occurred after the lawmaker had been convicted on federal charges.  McCarthy said he would reach out to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., about referring the resolution to the Ethics Committee, which already has initiated an investigation into whether Santos engaged in unlawful activity with respect to his congressional campaign.  “I think we can look at it very quickly and come to a conclusion on what George Santos did and did not do,” McCarthy told reporters.  Democrats are looking to tie Santos to the Republican brand, particularly in key swing districts, and began messaging the effort to expel him as giving New Yorkers the “honest representation they deserve.”  \"Now is the time for members of Congress to demonstrate where they stand and expel George Santos from Congress,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  ___  Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nRep.

        "text": "© Provided by Mediaite  Daily Wire CEO Jeremy Boreing issued a forceful condemnation of and apology for an article published by the site on Wednesday morning.  “This is a disgusting piece, and I’m sorry we ran it,” tweeted Boreing, linking to an article about the presence of a Pride flag on the set of The Chosen, a series about the life of Jesus Christ.  “A show like The Chosen has 100+ employees. One of them brought a pride flag to work. That sucks, but it’s hardly the fault of the show,” wrote Boreing. He continued:  The producer’s response also sucks, but it isn’t untrue. There is no ‘you don’t have to hire gay people if you don’t agree with homosexuality’ allowance in US labor law. On the whole, this piece reeks of ‘purity death spiral’ politics. Unless you are perfect – as defined by the ever-and-rapidly-changing sensibilities of the moment, you aren’t even good. That way lies madness. Hold people and organizations accountable, yes. Hold them to impossible standards and require death for their sins? I think actual Jesus had something to say about that.  The appearance of the flag was first inquired about online after observers noticed it in the background of a promotional video for the show. The series’ official twitter account responded to inquires about it by explaining that “Just like with our hundreds of cast and crew who have different beliefs (or no belief at all) than we do, we will work with anyone on our show who helps us portray or honor the authentic Jesus. We ask that audiences let the show speak for itself and focus on the message, not the messenger, because we’ll always let you down.”  According to the Daily Wire piece, The Chosen may violate the Second Commandment and contradict “the sufficiency of Scripture.” It ends with a quote from Travis Kerns of the Three Rivers Baptist Association asserting that “When this amusement comes alongside, takes the place of, or supersedes Scripture, we have removed the Bible as the sufficient guide for the Christian life and replaced it with something else.”  Boreing’s denunciation of the article is notable given the outspoken opposition to gay marriage of some of The Daily Wire’s most famous talent, including Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro, to gay marriage and transgender activism.

        "text": "© Provided by NBC News Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at a political roundtable, in Bedford, N.H., on May 19. During his opening 2024 pitch to voters on Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis promised to crack down aggressively on crime. But the next day he made it clear that upholding the law might not be so important to him when it comes to accountability for insurrectionists and former President Donald Trump. On “The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show,” DeSantis was asked whether he would consider pardoning Jan. 6 defendants — including Trump, who is currently under federal investigation over Jan. 6, but hasn’t been charged. DeSantis indicated that he’d open to it. “On day one, I will have folks that will get together and look at all these cases, who people are victims of weaponization or political targeting, and we will be aggressive in issuing pardons,” DeSantis said. “I would say any example of disfavored treatment based on politics, or weaponization would be included in that review, no matter how small or how big,” he added. DeSantis’ broadside against the idea of rule of law signals that overturning the rulings of the legal system isn’t just a consideration, but an expectation: “We will be aggressive in issuing pardons.” It’s also notable that pardoning Jan. 6 defendants is a “day one” priority for him, suggesting that the convictions of insurrectionists who tried to overturn the 2020 election was a grave injustice. And he refuses to rule out the idea of pardoning Trump, regardless of whether prosecutors are able to indict him with a crime. DeSantis’ posture rests upon the unfounded assumption that federal prosecutors are part of a political conspiracy rather than agents of the law. And naturally he tossed in his obsession with so-called wokeness into his reasoning. “Some of these cases, some people may have a technical violation of the law. But if there are three other people who did the same thing, but just in a context like Black Lives Matter, and they don’t get prosecuted at all, that is uneven application of justice,” DeSantis said, referring to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. “And so we’re going to find ways where that did not happen and then we will use the pardon power, and I will do that at the front end.” DeSantis was trotting out a common right-wing narrative that Jan. 6 protestors faced an unfair double standard compared to people who broke the law during BLM protests the summer after police killed George Floyd. But as the U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan pointed out during a sentencing hearing in 2021, the BLM demonstrators were protesting for civil rights while the latter group was “trying to overthrow the government. … That is no mere protest.” Black Lives Matter advocates have also collected data showing that federal prosecutors were far from gentle in their approach to charging Black Lives Matter protestors, and an Associated Press analysis in 2021 showed scores of BLM defendants getting serious prison sentences, shattering the myth that prosecutors were exceptionally lenient with them. DeSantis’ attitude toward Jan. 6 should dismay anyone who takes democracy seriously. He didn’t point to specific examples of what he saw as overly harsh sentencing, but instead signaled a general eagerness to use pardoning to undermine the rule of law and the sanctity of the democratic process. DeSantis might want to beat Trump in his bid for the White House, but these signs indicate he’s playing a similar game.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has indicated that he would consider pardoning those involved in the January 6th insurrection, and that he would be \"aggressive\" in issuing pardons.\nHe has suggested that those involved in the insurrection were victims of political targeting and weaponization, and that they faced an unfair double standard compared to those involved in Black Lives Matter protests.\nHowever, data and analysis have shown that BLM protestors were not treated leniently by prosecutors.\nDeSantis' attitude towards the insurrectionists signals a willingness to undermine the rule of law and the sanctity of the democratic process.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has indicated he is open to pardoning Jan. 6 defendants, including former President Donald Trump.\nDeSantis has promised to be \"aggressive\" in issuing pardons, regardless of whether prosecutors are able to indict Trump with a crime.\nDeSantis has suggested that federal prosecutors are part of a political conspiracy rather than agents of the law.\nBlack Lives Matter advocates have collected data showing that federal prosecutors were far from gentle in their approach to charging BLM protestors."

Around 9 p.m. local time on May 14, the National Park Service responded to a report of a pulseless and unresponsive hiker on the Bright Angel Trail above the Three-Mile Resthouse. While her name was not released, authorities identified her as a 36-year-old woman from Westfield, Indiana. The Bright Angel Trail is the most popular trail in the Grand Canyon, but like all trails that lead into the canyon, is steep and difficult, according to the park's website. Hikers making their way down to the Colorado River are recommended they consult a park ranger for safety tips.

Rangers also advised against hiking in the inner canyon between the hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., as there have been many heat-related illnesses that occur in that range, Baird said. \"Hiking in extreme heat can lead to serious health risks including heat exhaustion, heat stroke, hyponatremia (a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance from drinking too much water and not consuming enough salt), and death,\" Baird said. \"Be aware that NPS efforts to assist hikers may be delayed during the summer months due to limited staff, the number of rescue calls, employee safety requirements, and limited helicopter flying capability during periods of extreme heat or inclement weather.\" According to park experts, important equipment to bring for a safe hike include \"balancing food, electrolyte, and water intake; drinking when thirsty; getting wet to stay cool; and stopping hiking if you start to feel ill,\" said Baird.

City officials in Phoenix, more than 200 miles south of the Grand Canyon, has provided the following safety measures that hikers should take when hitting the trails: Watch the weather: Yes, \"it's a dry heat\" − but Arizona's temperature can be deceiving and deadly. Hike when it's cold outside, try early mornings and evenings when there's more shade. Dress appropriately: Wear proper shoes, clothing, hat and sunscreen. Bring water: Hydrate before you go. Have plenty of water, more than you think you need. Turn around and head back to the trailhead before you drink half of your water. Keep in contact: Carry a mobile phone. Team up: Hike with others. If hiking solo, tell someone your start and end times, and location. Be honest: Do you have a medical condition? Asthma, heart problems, diabetes, knee or back problems? Don't push yourself! \"Even trained athletes have been caught off guard by getting dehydrated on Arizona trails.\" Don't trailblaze: Enjoy the Sonoran Desert's beautiful and undeveloped landscape, but please stay on designated trails. Take responsibility: Don't be \"that person\" − the one who wasn't prepared, shouldn't have been there for health reasons or ignored safety guidelines.

Girkin on Sunday continued to accuse Wagner Group leadership of plotting a mutiny against the Kremlin.  Former Russian commander Igor Girkin on Sunday continued to accuse the Wagner Group of inching toward conflict with Russian forces.  Girkin rose to prominence as a commander of separatist forces in Ukraine's Donbas region and is now a prominent military blogger advocating for Russian nationalist principles. In comments made last week, he accused Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group mercenary outfit, of plotting a coup against the Kremlin after he made several comments critical of Russian forces in Ukraine.  Prigozhin's forces had, at the time, recently landed significant assistance in the Russian military's ongoing attempt to take control of the Bakhmut, a city in Eastern Ukraine. After announcing that his forces would be retreating back to Russia, Prigozhin issued statements severely critical of Russian forces over their handling of the Bakhmut conflict and claimed that the entire war in Ukraine had backfired.  Newsweek reached out via email to Defense Priorities, a think tank with military experts.  In response, Girkin accused Prigozhin of plotting to stage a mutiny against the Russian government with his forces as they made their return home.  \"If Prigozhin remains the head of Wagner, the mutiny will come quickly and radically,\" Girkin said in a video shared by the WarTranslated watchdog group. \"A coup attempt has been declared...What will happen next, I don't know, especially as Wagner is urgently withdrawn to rear bases...The danger of a looming coup is clear.\"  On Friday, Prigozhin released statements antagonizing Russian military forces, this time accusing them of placing land mine on the routes that his Wagner forces used to retreat from Bakhmut.  \"Just before exiting [Bakhmut] we detected suspicious activities along our exit routes,\" Prigozhin said. \"We called law enforcement agencies and found around a dozen locations with dozens of explosive devices: hundreds of anti-tank mines to tons of plastic explosives... There was no need to place those devices to hold enemy forces back, they were all behind the frontlines. We can therefore assume that those explosives were destined for the Wagner PMC.\"  In response, Girkin took to his official Telegram account to once again accuse Prigozhin of conspiring against Russia with his comments, dismissing the alleged land mines as unintentional \"friendly fire.\"  \"Another step towards turmoil,\" Girkin wrote, as translated by the online tool Yandex. \"Even if (most likely, by the way) we are talking only about 'friendly fire' and inconsistency of actions (which is very common at the front) - Prigozhin's statements and this publication are a provocation of an open war between units that previously fought on the same side of the front...Prigozhin must be arrested immediately for this and put on trial by military court.\"  Related Articles  Start your unlimited Newsweek trial<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFormer Russian commander Igor Girkin has accused Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group mercenary outfit, of plotting a coup against the Kremlin.\nPrigozhin had recently made several comments critical of Russian forces in Ukraine and accused them of placing land mines on the routes his Wagner forces used to retreat from Bakhmut.\nIn response, Girkin has called for Prigozhin to be arrested and put on trial by military court for his alleged provocation of an open war between units that previously fought on the same side of the front.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFormer Russian commander Igor Girkin accused Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group mercenary outfit, of plotting a coup against the Kremlin. \nPrigozhin released statements antagonizing Russian military forces, accusing them of placing land mines on the routes that his Wagner forces used to retreat from Bakhmut. \nGirkin took to his official Telegram account to once again accuse Prigozhin of conspiring against Russia with his comments. \nPrigozhin must be arrested immediately for this and put on trial by military court, according to Girkin."

        "text": "© Provided by The Telegraph Protestors at Sussex University rally against Professor Kathleen Stock  It is surely undeniable that unions – those representing both students and staff – care more about the “rights’ of trans people than those of women. Women are routinely de-platformed and face protests when invited to speak on campus.  Those of us who have a long history of fighting for the rights of lesbians, and those campaigning to end men’s violence, often bear the brunt of this. The latest debacle involving my friend Kathleen Stock is a very good example of how certain women are specifically singled out to suffer the most atrocious behaviour from these idiotic students, on many occasions with the backing of academic staff.  Kathleen is due to speak at Oxford University at the end of the month, and the blue-fringed protestors have been out in force ever since the event was announced. As soon as anyone utters the word “transphobia’, the powers-that-be capitulate in a sickening way, throwing fine feminists such as Kathleen to the wolves.  The university’s LGBTQ+ society has released a statement condemning the union for the invitation, accusing Stock of being a “transphobic and trans-exclusionary speaker”. Additionally, and quite remarkably, the society accused the union of ignoring the welfare of its members under the guise of free speech. The Oxford Union has since said it will provide “welfare resources” to students given the “sensitive nature” of the occasion. A porn performer recently took part in an event at the university despite the fact that some women might find this offensive or triggering, and I have no problem with that.  This whole “culture war’ is nothing more than misogyny and the targeting of the women daring to question transgender ideology. Kathleen has been targeted since the publication of her book Material Girls – a feminist treatise on the material reality of biological sex.  “LGBTQ+” would be more accurately termed “GBTQ+” on campus. The trans activists have such sway over academics and other staff that many turn to putty as soon as the term “transphobe” is uttered. In a place where young people’s ideas and worldviews should be challenged and put to the test, this is a tragedy.  A few years back I was invited to a university in the US to debate a men’s rights activist on the theme of “Has feminism gone too far?” My opponent was reportedly in favour of criminalising abortion and decriminalising “date rape”. Astonishingly, the pickets on campus focused on me, not him. The LGBTQ+ caucus objected to my presence on the basis that I was so transphobic I would trigger suicidal ideation among transgender students.  The students had already done their very best to have me disinvited from the event. When that failed, the university set up a “safe space” in a teaching room on the other side of campus. There were trained counsellors on site, the room was littered with soft toys, and there were even a couple of dogs and cats brought along. I was told by someone who had popped in to observe that the walls were strewn with “affirmative statements” such as “trans women are women” and “non-binary identities are valid”.  Then there was the time at Essex university, when I was debating whether or not porn was harmful to women. My opponent was seemingly given a warm welcome by a sea of students totally uninterested in my track record of fighting for women’s rights and obsessed with my reputation as a “transphobe”.  In June 2019, I was invited to give a talk on male violence at the University of Edinburgh as part of a panel looking at women’s sex-based rights and the current threats to those rights. On entering the university, I and the other speakers were treated to a huge protest of students (and some staff) draped in pink and blue trans flags, shouting through loudhailers that we were all bigots.  This latest attack on Kathleen Stock is an attack on the very foundations of a democratic society, not just on freedom of speech.

        "text": " The basis -generally speaking – is that during slavery and some years post-slavery, Blacks Americans were not able to gain the generational wealth seen today among their counter-groups of other ethnic backgrounds. While this is a fair argument, given the complicated historical background and circumstances of the late-1800s and the Reconstruction Era, it is very much impossible to just say – “If you’re Black in America, then you get a check!” Believe it or not, not ALL Blacks in America today can claim slavery affiliation from nearly 200-years ago.  © Provided by ---Thy Black Man 2023 - Black People - Reparations Now.  Some Blacks today will find that their very own ancestors, who were Black, owned slaves themselves. What about the Blacks who were freed and given land, money, and even business(es), but squandered it off, or fell victim to capitalism?  If my great great great Grandparents owned land and it was passed down through the generations and my grandparents decided to sell the land for some selfish reason and lose out on creating generational wealth, maybe got suckered into a bad deal, or simply blew the proceeds not leaving anything for their children and grandchildren, do WE have a right to demand a do over just because we were not beneficiaries of a sanctioned enterprise from centuries before? What do we say or do about the current market of slavery going on today in the form of human trafficking and sex trafficking going on in the US and even in countries in Africa where our ancestry comes from?  Some of our relatives may be current victims of modern-day slavery but we are mum on the situation because “It’s not us!” Many Black people today cannot trace their lineage further than their great grandparents – whom by the way were likely not slaves – so what metrics or standards will be applied to Black Americans today to qualify them for a “Reparations package”?  Oh, by the way, since we are in the era of IDENTIFYING as whatever we want, EVERY PERSON in the United States will identify as Black. Afterall, Black people started humanity out of Africa, right? Will the “One drop rule” apply to paying out reparations?  Let’s just say that every African American who can prove their genetic lineage to slavery ancestry was the only mechanism used to qualify them for this “payment”, what will the amount be? Where does it come from? Is it one-time, quarterly, annually? What is stopping the subsequent generations from demanding reparations once this issue is “paid in full!? Hence, we are having this discussion again post-reconstruction. Can African Americans deal with the consequences and repercussions of the social ills and resentment from other Blacks and ethnic groups that didn’t get a penny or the equivalent thereof? Understand the difference between African American and Black, and there is a difference. To my fellow African Americans and Black people, stop falling for the gimmick that some politician, organization, or BS commission tells you that you are owed reparations and you will get it.  The only thing that will come from it is the fact you will run to the nearest polling booth and check their name and they will smile at the idea of sucking you in their sleep or on their way to the nearest bank to cash that check from the non-profit they created in the name of fighting for reparations for “Black people.”  Finish story here; Black Community: Blacks Fall for the Reparations Gimmick Again.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nIt is impossible to say that all Black Americans today are owed reparations due to slavery. \nNot all Black Americans can trace their lineage to slavery, and the \"one drop rule\" would not apply to reparations. \nPoliticians, organizations, and commissions may be using the reparations issue to gain votes and money. \nAfrican Americans should be wary of falling for the reparations gimmick.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the complexities of reparations for African Americans and Black people in the United States.\nIt questions the metrics used to qualify people for reparations, the amount of money that would be paid out, and where it would come from.\nIt also questions the consequences of reparations and the potential resentment from other ethnic groups that don't receive any money.\nThe article ultimately warns against falling for the reparations gimmick and encourages people to think critically about the issue."

        "text": "The World Health Organization said Monday it is advising people not to use nonsugar sweeteners for weight control, warning that they may increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.  The agency said a systematic review of the available evidence suggests nonsugar sweeteners do not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children.  “NSS are not essential dietary factors and have no nutritional value,” said Francesco Branca, WHO director for nutrition and food safety, in a statement. “People should reduce the sweetness of the diet altogether, starting early in life, to improve their health.”  The news was greeted with dismay by the International Sweeteners Association, whose members include PepsiCo Inc. Celanese Corp. Cargill and Tate & Lyle PLC among others.  “The ISA joins others, including relevant government agencies around the globe, who have responded to the public consultation on the draft guideline expressing their concerns about the conclusions and rationale used by WHO,” the association said in a statement.  “ISA agrees with the UK’s Office for Health Improvement and Disparities that commented “the guideline may go too far” and with the Australian government’s Department of Health and Aged Care who wrote that “the recommendation may result in undesirable health outcomes for some individuals.”  The WHO could only conclude a “conditional recommendation,” said the statement, because it did not include all available evidence.  That means it’s not “scientifically rigorous, nor based on a robust evidence base or supported by the evidence presented in the WHO-commissioned systematic review itself,” it added.  The new guidance applies to all people apart from those already living with diabetes, and includes all synthetic, naturally occurring or modified non-nutritive sweeteners that are not classified as sugars, including acesulfame K, aspartame, advantame, cyclamates, neotame, saccharin, sucralose, stevia and stevia derivatives, said the WHO statement.  The Calorie Control Council (CCC), an international association representing the low-calorie food and beverage industry, said the move was misguided, and noted that the WHO is not considering the value of NSS for people living with diabetes, who account for more than 10% of the global population.  “It is mind-boggling that persons living with diabetes, for whom non-sugar sweeteners can have an especially meaningful ‎role in their compliance with necessary dietary requirements, were conveniently not considered ‎when creating these guidelines,” said Dr. Keith Ayoob, scientific adviser to the council said in emailed comments.’  “The WHO’s insistence on focusing only on prevention of unhealthy ‎weight gain and non-communicable diseases is at the very least, misguided.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe World Health Organization has advised people not to use non-sugar sweeteners for weight control, as they may increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.\nThe agency found that non-sugar sweeteners do not reduce body fat in adults or children.\nThe International Sweeteners Association and the Calorie Control Council have expressed their concerns about the WHO's conclusions and rationale.\nThe WHO's recommendation applies to all people apart from those already living with diabetes.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe World Health Organization is advising people not to use non-sugar sweeteners for weight control.\nNon-sugar sweeteners may increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality in adults.\nThe International Sweeteners Association has expressed concerns about the WHO's conclusions and rationale.\nThe WHO's guidance applies to all people apart from those already living with diabetes."

        "text": "© Provided by LGBTQNation The trans barista was doxxed as the video went viral, leading to transphobes knocking on her and her family members' front doors.  Luna Spain — a 28-year-old transgender former manager of a Starbucks coffeehouse in Southampton, England — is demanding that the company that licensed the coffeehouse apologize for firing her after a video of her confrontation with a transphobic customer went viral on social media and right-wing mediasphere.  Video recently emerged of an April confrontation between Spain and an older woman who has since been identified as Vanessa Thomas. The video begins with Spain talking to Thomas and Thomas shouting, “Don’t ever call me transphobic, ever. You do not know me.”  Spain then points at Thomas and says, “You’re being transphobic, Karen,” a slang term for an entitled and unreasonably demanding white woman, often in a retail or fast food context. “Get out!” Spain urges Thomas while gesturing toward the exit.  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  Thomas repeats, “Do not call me transphobic.” Spain responds by clapping in her face, “You. Are. Transphobic. Now get out!”  “Absolutely,” Thomas says, as Spain responds, “You are trespassing now. Get out.” Thomas then mentions that cameras are recording their interaction. Spain then walks onto the patio to try to grab the phone of the man recording — he has since been identified as Thomas’s partner Mark Andrews, according to Vice News.  Andrews says, “Do you want some?” possibly insinuating a hostile confrontation. Spain replies, “Give me the phone.” Andrews says, “Let go of me. I’ve got plenty of witnesses,” as Thomas continues shouting in the background. The video ends soon after.  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  After the video went viral on social media and among right-wing media outlets like The Daily Mail and GB News, Spain said transphobes began abusing her online and in real life, even going so far as to publish her address and contact details online, leading to people knocking on her and her family members’ front doors.  However, Spain told Vice News the video doesn’t capture Thomas’ transphobic comments beforehand. Spain said Thomas referred to Spain and a trans male co-worker as “tr**nies” and misgendered both of them after she became upset about the coffeehouse not accepting cash for payment.  “[Thomas began] losing her mind after she deliberately misgendered my colleague standing next to me and I corrected her pronouns,” Spain said, adding that the misgendering “was deliberate and spiteful, not a mistake” as Thomas and others have reportedly claimed online.  “She said, ‘What is it with you tr**nies and all this gender stuff’ and ‘with you tr**nies it’s always all about gender’ – I cut her off and told her she’s not getting served. I asked her to come to the till and get a refund. But instead, she started getting louder and louder. She was calling me ‘a man’ as much as she could, and calling my colleague who is a trans man ‘a woman’ in front of a full store of customers and colleagues,” Spain said.  Spain said neither she nor her co-workers had ever dealt with such an incident before. She also said that she grabbed Andrews’ phone to get the video deleted so that she wouldn’t be targeted online as other trans people have been.  One customer who hid their identity for fear of retaliation told the aforementioned publication that Spain tried to de-escalate the situation but that Thomas should’ve just left rather than causing a scene.  Vice found that Thomas’s and Andrews’s social media profiles contained transphobic slurs, including on Andrews’s original posted video in which he reportedly referred to Spain as “he,” “it,” and “that.” In a comment, Thomas reportedly wrote, “I would have knocked it out if there weren’t cameras,” adding a cry-laughing emoji.  The coffeehouse workers notified senior management about the incident, and management initially supported Spain’s actions, Spain said. However, Spain received a call from the coffeehouse’s licensee, a company called 23.5 Degrees, asking her to resign. When she refused, she received an email one hour later firing her.  “There was no investigation, no meeting, just a cold email,” Spain said. She said she wants 23.5 Degrees to formally apologize for firing her and is pursuing possible legal action against Thomas for publicly lying about Spain and also against right-wing media outlets for “publishing my name, address, and private photos without even asking me for a comment.”  In a statement about Spain’s firing, a Starbucks spokesperson said: “We pride ourselves on offering a welcoming and inclusive environment, and expect everyone, including our green apron partners (employees) and customers, to treat one another with dignity and respect. Following an investigation, it was determined by the licensee that this partner be separated from the company.”  In the U.S., Starbucks has a perfect 100 out of 100 rating on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index, a measure of a company’s pro-LGBTQ+ workplace policies. The company’s health insurance provides coverage for gender-affirming care for employees who work an average of at least 20 hours per week. In May 2022, Starbucks announced that it would pay travel costs for trans employees getting gender-affirming care in states that haven’t restricted such care.  Correction (5/19/23): A previous version of this story mistakenly attributed Spain’s firing to Starbucks rather than 23.5 Degrees, the company that licensed the coffeehouse and oversees its human resources.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nLuna Spain, a 28-year-old transgender former manager of a Starbucks coffeehouse in Southampton, England, is demanding an apology from the company that licensed the coffeehouse after she was fired following a viral video of her confrontation with a transphobic customer.\nSpain claims that the customer had misgendered her and her trans male co-worker before the video began.\nAfter the video went viral, Spain was doxxed and transphobes began harassing her and her family.\nShe is now seeking legal action against the customer and right-wing media outlets for publishing her personal information.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nLuna Spain, a 28-year-old transgender former manager of a Starbucks coffeehouse in Southampton, England, is demanding an apology from the company that licensed the coffeehouse for firing her after a video of her confrontation with a transphobic customer went viral. \nThe video shows Spain confronting the customer and telling her to leave, and the customer claiming that cameras are recording the interaction. \nAfter the video went viral, Spain was doxxed and transphobes began knocking on her and her family members' front doors. \nStarbucks has a perfect 100 out of 100 rating on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index and provides coverage for gender-affirming care for employees."

        "text": "Â© Raw Story Donald Trump and Mike Pence  Former Justice Department official Mary McCord penned a column for MSNBC in which she suggested one of the crimes that special counsel Jack Smith might be looking at relates to former Vice President Mike Pence.  Last week, Pence was discovered to have spent a full day with the grand jury around the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and attempt to overthrow the 2020 election.  McCord noted that thus far, the conversation has centered around former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the election and incite a riot. She feels it's neglecting one key piece of the legal possibilities: Trump solicited Pence to commit a felony.  \"The U.S. Code makes it a crime to solicit any other person to engage in conduct that is a felony under federal law involving the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against a person (in other words, a federal felony that is a crime of violence),\" wrote McCord. \"Under this statute, the government must prove the defendant intended the person to commit a crime of violence and that the defendant 'under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicit[ed], command[ed], induce[ed], or otherwise endeavor[ed] to persuade' the other person to engage in such conduct.\"  She specifically cited the Jan. 4, 2021, meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump, Pence and lawyer John Eastman among others, were on hand to debate whether Pence could refuse to accept the certification of the election. Pence writes about it in his book in which he explains that even Eastman acknowledged it wouldn't make it through the Supreme Court.  But in Georgia that night, Trump continued public pressure on Pence, saying, âI hope Mike Pence comes through for us.â He called Pence as a âgreat vice president,â but âof course, if he doesnât come through, I wonât like him quite as much.â  Trump then tweeted the following day, âThe Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.â  Pence's book goes on to say that later that day, Trump called him into the office again, where the two met alone. Pence made it clear the law wasn't on Trump's side.  âThese people cheated, and you want to play by Marquess of Queensberry rules,â Trump said, according to Pence's book. \"Hundreds of thousands are gonna hate your guts.â  Trump then said in a statement that he and Pence were on the same page. They weren't.  Trump went on to tweet that all Pence had to do was \"send them back to the States (sic), AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!\"  The two then had a phone call in which Trump was screaming at Pence for being a \"wimp\" and a \"p--sy.\"  Trump told his crowd at the Ellipse on Jan. 6: âI hope Mike is going to do the right thing. â¦ Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. â¦ He has the absolute right to do it.â  He told them they would walk down to the Capitol together, with him too. âYouâll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong. â¦ We fight like hell, and if you donât fight like hell, youâre not going to have a country anymore.â  So, Trump's supporters marched to the Capitol. Trump told his Twitter followers that Pence had abandoned them. So, the group built a gallows and began chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence\" while searching for him in the Capitol.  There is testimony from top White House aides who confirm the account, including Mark Meadows feeling hopeless because Trump believed that Pence should be hanged.  \"Itâs no defense that the Secret Service was successful in whisking Pence away before the mob could catch him,\" explained McCord. \"The law does not require that the crime of violence be completed. That leaves just two questions: Did Trump intend for the attackers to commit a crime of violence against his vice president, and 'under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent,' did Trump solicit, command, induce or otherwise endeavor to persuade them to do so?\"  That's for Smith to decide, she closed.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner A Texas state trooper vehicle passes a posted wanted sign for a mass shooting suspect Tuesday, May 2, 2023, in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred Friday, in Cleveland, Texas. The search for the suspected gunman who allegedly shot five of his neighbors, including a child, after they asked him to stop firing off rounds in his yard stretched into a fourth day Tuesday.  A gunman brutally murdered five people, including a 9-year-old child, in Texas last week. The alleged attacker, Francisco Oropesa, is an illegal immigrant and has been deported four times already. He should not be here.  Two days after the shooting, Gov. Greg Abbott's (R-TX) office released a statement offering a reward for a \"fugitive who is in the country illegally and killed five illegal immigrants.\" The next day, an Abbott spokesperson revised the information by stating, \"we’ve since learned that at least one of the victims may have been in the United States legally.\" Law enforcement captured Oropesa on Tuesday.  Abbott is the Republican governor of one of the largest states in the nation, which also happens to border Mexico. He can do no right in the eyes of the legacy media when it comes to the issue of immigration. Cracking down on illegal immigrants is somehow heartless or anti-American. And apparently, using the term \"illegal immigrant\" while describing the deceased is also wrong. To the governor's credit, his office amended the information to correctly reflect reality. But a complete retraction seems to be what the media and others want.  Every life is precious, so it's a tragedy when anyone, whether illegal immigrant or American citizen, is gunned down. This goes without saying. Oropesa's alleged actions were evil on their own; they aren't more deranged because of his immigration status. The five victims were Diana Velazquez Alvarado, 21; Jose Jonathan Casarez, 18; Obdulia Molina Rivera, 31; Sonia Argentina Guzman, 25; and Daniel Enrique Laso Guzman, 9. Only one, Alvarado, was a legal resident. But the others are not worth less because of their immigration status. They didn't deserve to be shot to death. Period.  There is nothing wrong with combining black-and-white facts of a horrific incident, including specifics about the victims, in conjunction with the underlying truth that murder is a profoundly immoral act. Part of Abbott's initial statement also read, \"Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of the five victims that were taken in this senseless act of violence. I thank the men and women in law enforcement who are tirelessly working to ensure this criminal is caught and brought to justice.”  Those words clearly convey heartfelt anguish at the tragedy and determination to hold the suspect accountable. Law enforcement didn't treat it with reduced priority. Those saying the governor is cruel and intended to dehumanize the victims are quick to ignore his full statement and the actions taken since then.  Immigration status is particularly relevant when it comes to the shooter. The violence in Cleveland, Texas, follows several recent, high-profile mass shootings in other states. Once again, there is a demand for stricter gun control laws. But the calls for gun control in the wake of Oropesa's alleged rampage are ironic, to say the least. Oropesa isn't supposed to be in the country. He was deported not once but four times.  If immigration laws meant to keep Francisco Oropesa out of the United States couldn't even do that, how would stricter gun control measures prevent, eradicate, or greatly reduce gun violence? Oropesa's neighbors asked him to keep the noise down. He allegedly committed a heinous act of violence as a result. He was not held back by any moral or legal code.  Observers may personally not have chosen to include the term \"illegal immigrant\" in descriptions of the Cleveland, Texas, victims. But that's quite different from saying Abbott willfully intended to belittle the deceased. Texas law enforcement swiftly acted to capture the suspect. The lives lost are mourned as innocent victims of violence. The uproar over language is nothing but partisan politics.

        "text": "A Nebraska Republican state senator who voted for a combined anti-trans and anti-abortion bill that passed by one vote in the legislature has admitted that she didn’t pay attention to the issue.  State Senator Christy Armendariz represents the 18th District in the state.  Writing for New York magazine, journalist Lila Shapiro said that the senator “led me to a bench in an empty hallway” to say that she “found it puzzling that a reporter from New York would come all the way to Nebraska to cover this affair”.  “I don’t watch the news or get the newspaper,” she told the magazine. “Is there anything going on I should be aware of?”  The writer told Ms Armendariz that other states have passed other similar bills restricting trans and women’s reproductive rights and that an appeals court on the federal level in the Nebraska circuit had ruled that one of them was unconstitutional.  “So is it a big widespread thing?” she asked the writer, adding that regular Nebraska residents were unaware of the issue.  “I knocked doors for a year, and nobody brought this up,” the senator said, adding that she wished that the legislation had never been brought to the floor.  For three months, a group of lawmakers in the state ground nearly all legislative business in the state to a halt, grabbing the nation’s attention with a remarkable filibuster to stifle a bill that would end gender-affirming care for young transgender people.  Late Tuesday 16 May, Republican lawmakers broke through, advancing a bill that not only bans gender-affirming care for trans people under 19 years old but also tacks on an amendment to outlaw abortion after roughly 10 weeks of pregnancy and hands the state’s GOP-appointed medical officer the authority to set the rules for affirming care for trans youth.  Hundreds of protesters filled the capital in Lincoln, standing outside the doors and in the gallery above lawmakers while chanting “one more vote to save our lives”; only one senator would have had to defect from supporters of the bill to kill the legislation.  © Provided by The Independent (AP)  The vote – on the 78th day of a 90-day session – followed a series of manoeuvres that opponents argued were bending and breaking the rules of the state legislature to hammer through the legislation and avert the filibuster, which would allow opponents to occupy their allotted time to speak the bill to death.  “What you are attempting to do today is the lowest of the absolute lows,” state Senator Machaela Cavanaugh, who spearheaded the filibuster, told Republican lawmakers.  “You literally have to cheat at every moment of this debate in every possible way … You are allowing it to happen,” she added. “You do literally have blood on your hands, and if you vote for it, you will have buckets.”  State Senator Megan Hunt, the first openly LGBT+ member of the state legislature and the mother of a trans child, lambasted lawmakers for their “escape routes” from the capitol to avoid facing protesters.  “If you can’t go out and face them, you are not worthy,” she said. “Your legacy is filth.”  Protesters surrounded the state capitol chambers in Lincoln again on 19 May, chanting “keep your bans off our bodies” and “save our lives” as lawmakers made their final round of votes on the bill, which passed 33-15. The bill reached the exact number of votes needed to pass.  Republican Governor Jim Pillen signed it into law on Monday.  “We are working to inspire Nebraskans to get in the game so that abortion is simply unthinkable in the state of Nebraska,” Mr Pillen said, according to WOWT.  He called the legislation “the most significant win for [the] social conservative agenda that over a generation has seen in Nebraska. I think that’s something we need to clap and shout about”.  At a show in Nebraska hours after the vote on Friday night, the artist Lizzo lambasted the legislation from the stage. “It really breaks my heart that there are young people growing up in a world that doesn’t protect them,” she said.  “Don’t let anyone tell you who you are. ... These laws are not real. You are what’s real, and you deserve to be protected,” she said.  “Hat tip to Senator Armendariz, who says she doesn’t know anything about the issue, doesn’t pay attention to current events, and wishes the bill she voted for hadn’t been introduced. It passed by 1 vote,” wrote Ari Kohen, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.  “These are the people who devoted an entire legislative session to taking away people’s rights in the face of massive opposition from experts and ordinary citizens. They openly admit that none of their constituents mentioned this issue to them and they don’t know much about it,” he added. “We have a handful of legislators who care enough to listen and learn. And then we have the majority, who seem not to know or care what they’re doing as long as it feels right to them and they have the votes to do it. Awful.”  The Independent has requested comment from Ms Armendariz.  From news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

The St. Cloud organizers wrote on social media that their decision to cancel the event in June — which is Pride Month — was “difficult” and “not made lightly.”  Florida’s hard-right Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an array of legislation dubbed “discriminatory” by the Human Rights Campaign on Wednesday. Among the measures is a ban on gender-affirming care for minors of any kind, a ban on using a bathroom aligning with one’s gender identity, an expansion of the education law nicknamed “Don’t Say Gay,” and restrictions on performances by drag queens who are a quintessential part of Pride.  The legislation prompted Equality Florida, an LGBTQ+ civil rights group, to issue a travel advisory for the entire state.  “These laws have created a climate of fear and hostility for LGBTQIA+ people in Florida. We believe that holding an LGBTQIA+ event in this environment would put our community at risk,” the St. Cloud organizers said.  They added: “We hope that you understand our decision.”  The event, held south of Orlando, was set to include food, drink and entertainers, including drag queens. An event in Tampa called Pride on the River, set for September, was similarly canceled this week, with an organizer pointing to the public riverfront venue and spotlight on drag performers.  “In the end, we didn’t want to take any chances,” Carrie West, president of Tampa Pride, told the Tampa Bay Times.  Port St. Lucie, Florida, announced in April that its Pride parade would not go forward as planned in anticipation of the anti-drag law. The city, located north of Miami, also restricted what was formerly an all-ages Pride festival to people aged 21 and up, upsetting some parents.  DeSantis claims the anti-drag bill “protects children from sexually explicit content.” It uses vague phrasing such as “adult live performances” and “sexual excitement” to target drag shows, which are now banned in public areas and relegated in private areas to adult-only settings.  Drag, however, is like any other form of artistic expression — such as acting — that can be changed to fit the time and place appropriately.  Other organizers have come out to reassure their communities their events would go on as planned.  “Lake County Pride will never back down,” organizers of the Orlando-area county wrote on Facebook.  “No unconstitutional law will keep us from celebrating our PRIDE event, Lake County Pride Celebration 2023!”  St. Petersburg Pride is also a go.  The event bills itself as Florida’s largest LGBTQ+ Pride festival, expected to include a month of parties, concerts and family-friendly events culminating in a parade and street fair.  Organizer Dr. Byron Green told HuffPost that St. Pete Pride is in “constant communication” with city officials with the assistance of lawyers.  “We know it’d be a difficult call,” Green said when asked about canceling Pride in light of the Florida political climate.  “The first Pride was a riot that was started by drag queens and trans women of color,” Green said, referencing the Stonewall riot, “So for us, it would be disingenuous to not lean into that and support our drag artists and trans community in any way possible.”  “We absolutely will be leaning into supporting these artists,” Green added, “in ways that will allow us to stay within the bounds of local ordinances.”<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nOrganizers in St.\nCloud, Florida, have announced the cancellation of their LGBTQ+ Pride festival next month due to Florida's extreme new anti-LGBTQ+ laws.\nOther events have also been cancelled, while some organizers are doubling down and vowing to continue their events.\nThe legislation includes a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, a ban on using a bathroom aligning with one's gender identity, and restrictions on performances by drag queens.\nSt. Petersburg Pride is still going ahead, with organizers vowing to support drag artists and trans community in ways that will stay within the bounds of local ordinances.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nOrganizers in St. Cloud, Florida have cancelled their LGBTQ+ Pride festival due to Florida's extreme anti-LGBTQ+ laws. \nFlorida's hard-right Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, a ban on using a bathroom aligning with one's gender identity, and restrictions on performances by drag queens. \nOther event organizers are doubling down and refusing to cancel their events, such as Lake County Pride and St. Petersburg Pride. \nDrag is a form of artistic expression that can be changed to fit the time and place appropriately."

        "text": "Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) held a press conference with the goal of “exposing the book ban hoax.” DeSantis claimed that “mainstream media, unions, and leftist activists’” were perpetuating a “hoax of empty library bookshelves and political theater.”  He explained that his efforts to remove certain books from school libraries were merely to protect students from “indoctrination” and to remove “pornographic and inappropriate materials that have been snuck into our classrooms and libraries to sexualize our students violate our state education standards.”  A recent report by Popular Information has revealed that Florida schools have interpreted “pornography” so widely that long-beloved books with virtually no nudity whatsoever have been removed from certain libraries.  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  Popular Information obtained a survey of 23 school districts by the Florida Department of Education. In the press conference, DeSantis said the survey found that 87% of the 175 books removed throughout Florida were considered “pornographic, violent, or inappropriate for their grade level.” But the publication emphasized that the governor’s words were “wildly misleading” and made it seem like pornography was far more pervasive in schools than it actually is.  “By lumping together books that were labeled ‘pornographic, violent, or inappropriate,’ and then focusing on books deemed pornographic, DeSantis grossly distorts the percentage of books removed as ‘pornography,'” the report stated. “The survey reveals just 38 books were removed for violating that state’s pornography law, 22% of the total.”  And many of those books do not actually violate state law, which defines pornography as sexual conduct or nudity that “is harmful to minors.”  Harmful is defined as: ” (a) Predominantly appeals to a prurient, shameful, or morbid interest; (b) Is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material or conduct for minors; and (c) Taken as a whole, is without serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.”  For example, The Sleeping Beauty by Trina Schart Hyman was banned as pornography from one district because on one page, a character’s buttocks is slightly visible from a distance while she bathes.  Other books deemed “pornographic” have included Beloved by Toni Morrison, The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini, The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky, and one well-known Australian children’s book called Guess What? by Mem Fox. In this story, the main character bathes in the sink on a single page, but no private body parts are visible.  The Department of Education Survey also included bans of LGBTQ+ books that schools deemed “pornographic,” including Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe and This Book is Gay by Juno Dawson. Others deemed “inappropriate” for certain grade levels include All Are Welcome by Alexandra Penfold for its “illustrations of same-sex couples,” as well as Todd Parr’s beloved The Family Book, for teaching kids that “Some families have two moms or two dads.”  DeSantis has championed both the Don’t Say Gay law and the Stop Woke Act. The former prohibits class instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, and the latter aims to limit the instruction of topics related to the history of racism in the U.S.  In addition, Florida’s H.B. 1467, passed last July, requires books made available through school libraries and classroom libraries to be selected by a certified media specialist.  These pieces of legislation have fueled the removal of books about race and LGBTQ+ issues – even ones as innocent as And Tango Makes Three, a children’s picture book about two male penguins who adopt a chick.  Florida Democrats recently trolled DeSantis by launching a campaign to ban his own memoir from public schools in an effort to call attention to the vague and discriminatory state laws that have led school libraries to pull books from their shelves.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the book ban hoax perpetuated by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, which was revealed to be wildly misleading.\nThe survey of 23 school districts by the Florida Department of Education found that only 38 books were removed for violating the state's pornography law, and many of those books did not actually violate the law.\nThe bans have included beloved books with virtually no nudity, as well as LGBTQ+ books and books about race and racism.\nIn response, Florida Democrats have launched a campaign to ban DeSantis' own memoir from public schools in order to call attention to the vague and discriminatory state laws.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFlorida Gov.

        "text": "The battle over reparations is growing across the United States, as local, state and federal officials weigh everything up to seven-figure direct payments to Black Americans.  While some advocates call it a long-overdue policy addressing a history of oppression, its foes call it a misguided, divisive and harmful approach that exacerbates issues rather than solving them. Polls show it is broadly unpopular with Americans, but it nevertheless has received serious attention in both Washington and municipalities around the country.  © Fox News Digital Bush led a group of House Democrats and activists from across the country in unveiling the resolution outside of the U.S. Capitol  Rep. Cori Bush D-Mo., alongside several other progressive lawmakers, unveiled the Reparations NOW resolution last week, calling for $14 trillion in reparations for Black Americans.  \"The United States has a moral and legal obligation to provide reparations for the enslavement of Africans and its lasting harm on the lives of millions of Black people,\" Bush said in a news conference.  Amid the debate, policy experts are divided on the feasibility and necessity of reparations.  TAMPA MAN DEMANDS $3 MILLION FOR EVERY BLACK PERSON IN VIRAL VIDEO: ‘WE HAVE TO PUT WHITE PEOPLE ON NOTICE’  READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP  \"The reason why we are experiencing this momentum at the moment is because the present is catching up with overdue history,\" Cornell William Brooks, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, told Fox News Digital, adding that the push is to make amends for America’s history of slavery.  \"Reparations is about repair,\" Brooks said. \"And that may mean a variety of forms of reparations to people who have been harmed in different ways, children who've been harmed, adults who have been or are the descendants of chattel slaves, but also those who have endured the harm of Jim Crow segregation.\"  Brooks, who is a civil rights attorney and also formerly served as the president and CEO of the NAACP, said people should not be making money allocations until a larger conversation is had.  \"We want to talk about receipts and price tags before we talk about harm, and we don't do that in any other context,\" Brooks said.  He added that when someone is a victim of a crime, they are first asked about how they were a victim before discussing monetary value.  \"So before we had this big conversation about who and, you know, receipts and checks, let's make sure we have a conversation about who's been harmed and how,\" he added. \"My fear is that—as I like to put it—the economic ‘how’ paralyzes the moral ‘why,’ and we won't get to reparations at all.\"  WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE  Robert Woodson, a civil rights activist who opposes reparations, said the push is purely political.  \"My most cynical self says that this is more about the elections of 2024 than it's about reparations from 1619,\" Woodson said, who is also the founder and president of the Woodson Center.  Woodson, who went viral for slamming reparations on \"Dr. Phil\" last month, told Fox News Digital that reparations would not solve the problems facing the Black community today.  \"In order to solve a problem, you've got to properly diagnose, and reparations is no answer for the challenges facing large numbers of Blacks in these cities,\" he said. \"It is lethal to continue to direct attention away from the critical problems and challenges facing Blacks and reparations is a major distraction.\"  \"It's a ploy,\" Woodson said. \"It's just keeping us all at each other's throats, and it's being used cynically by people who really are trying to undermine the fundamental values of this nation.\"  'SQUAD' MEMBER RIPPED FOR DEMANDING TRILLIONS IN REPARATIONS: 'CREATING US VERSUS THEM MENTALITY'  Municipalities and states have also taken action. The California Reparations Task Force recommended $1.2 million in payments to every qualifying Black state resident earlier this month.  Evanston, Illinois approved a plan to distribute $25,000 for home repairs or down payments on property for qualified Black residents, and a proposed plan in San Francisco is estimated to cost over $100 billion.  Other cities and organizations have developed commissions to study and consider whether to enact reparations, including a group of Democratic mayors, Mayors Organized for Reparations and Equity, which announced a partnership in 2021 to take action.  Jesse Rhodes, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who polled Americans about their opinion of reparations, told Fox News Digital that strides are being made at the local level because of \"political feasibility.\"  \"If what we're thinking about in the short run is viability and progress; where it's possible, where the communities support it, it's most likely to be occurring at the municipal level,\" he said.  Rhodes helped work on a 2021 poll that found nearly two-thirds of Americans oppose reparations.  \"A lot of the conversations about reparations today are very much tied up with the Black Lives Matter movement,\" Rhodes said, adding that the conversation extends beyond slave descendants to people affected by Jim Crow and segregation.  ‘WOKE IDEOLOGY’: LAWMAKERS ON DEMS’ $14 TRILLION REPARATIONS DEMAND TO ADDRESS HARMS 'SINCE THE FOUNDING’  Andre Perry, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro, said reparations are not uncommon in America, citing payments to Japanese Americans interned during World War II and different forms of compensation for Native American groups.  When asked why Americans who are not descendants of slave owners or descendants of Union soldiers should have to contribute to reparations, he said everyone has an obligation to pay for America’s past atrocities.  \"The victims of 9/11 and their families receive reparations, but I was not involved in the hijacking and that tragedy,\" he said. \"And I am more than happy in making sure those families are taken care of.\"  \"This is about our civic obligation to those who are citizens, who are our civic brothers and sisters,\" Perry added.  When it comes to discussions about what exactly reparations look like and who qualifies for them, the policy experts were hesitant to get into specifics.  Perry said reparations will require \"a significant amount of studying by sociologists, economists, educationists and others\" but should also include acknowledgment of wrongdoing.  \"It's not just about programs,\" he said. \"It's also about a formal apology and an acknowledging that racism robbed people of the opportunity to grow.\"  SAN FRANCISCO REPARATIONS TASK FORCE MEMBER TOUTS TAX ON BILLIONAIRES TO GET $5 MILLION PER CITY RESIDENT  Richard Epstein, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, said calculating the costs for reparations owed is not realistic.  \"The thought that the wealth that was around in 1865 has just been put in an idle bank account accruing interest for the next 150 years, and we could gather it, this is just another one of these kinds of fantasies,\" he said.  Fox News contributor DeRoy Murdock called the push for reparations \"a complete disaster.\"  \"This is a stupid, misguided idea, especially when you see states like California bending over backward to spend money they don't have,\" he said. \"Amid a $33-billion budget deficit to provide reparations to people in a state that was never part of the Confederacy nor involved in the Civil War.\"  \"Let's say that you had relatives who were defending the Union and attacking the Confederacy by shooting at and killing Confederate soldiers and your great-great-great-great grandpa died at Gettysburg or Antietam or Shiloh,\" he said. \"Do you get a discount? Do you get to pay as much as people whose families may have owned plantations?\"  DeRoy also mocked the MORE mayor group for nearly half of its 13 members coming from non-slave states.  \"You have a lot of left-wing Democrat mayors, who this is their new toy, and they're going to take a new toy, play with it,\" he said. \"Maybe the reason they're holding on to and pushing the reparations thing is this is a kind of fun little project to work on rather than actually sit down, OK, how do we lower crime in this community?\"  Echoing Woodson, DeRoy believes that the recent push for reparations is due to the upcoming presidential election.  Former Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, D., who founded MORE, told the New York Times he planned to \"double or even triple\" the group’s membership. The group has remained inactive on social media and media hits since 2021 and added just two members since Garcetti’s comments.

        "text": " They’re pushing for book bans, unfettered access to guns, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, abortion restrictions and more — all in the name of “God.”  These sorts of hate-filled biblical interpretations might appeal to politicians’ bright-red bases. But overwhelmingly — at the ballot box and beyond — young people are showing us that they will not buy into them.  Quite frankly, for too many young people, religion means embracing weapons that kill their peers. It means stopping them from having control over their bodies. It means restricting people from loving who they want to love.  By and large, young Americans don’t want to be part of that. They want to join communities that provide safety, support and acceptance.  Just look at some of the purportedly “Christian” messages young Americans have heard recently.  This month, Missouri State Rep. Brad Hudson — a pastor and the sponsor of a looming bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors — said that he would advise adults seeking to transition to “embrace the way that God made them.”  North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson — who just launched his gubernatorial campaign — recently stated that God formed him to fight against LGBTQ+ rights and that flying a rainbow flag in a church is a “direct spit in the face of God almighty.”  Days after a shooter slaughtered three children and three adults at Christian Covenant School, far-right influencer Charlie Kirk said that gun deaths are worth it “so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”  And as state representatives debated a draconian 6-week abortion ban in Florida, several lawmakers cited their religious beliefs to support the bill.  Young people are wholeheartedly rejecting these messages. In recent months, young people have spearheaded major protests to condemn a wide variety of far-right efforts — like loose gun rules in Tennessee and the silencing of trans lawmaker Rep. Zooey Zephyr.  Young voters also showed up in unprecedented numbers to resoundingly elect a pro-choice judge to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  Simultaneously, young people are going to church less often and increasingly consider themselves religiously unaffiliated. In fact, recent data shows that nearly half of Gen Zers have no religious affiliation.  That’s no coincidence. They simply don’t feel like they can connect with traditional faith institutions. In fact, a brand-new survey from PRRI found that 30% of people who switched religions said that they were turned off by the religion’s negative teachings about or treatment of LGBTQ+ people.  Far-right leaders know they’re losing with young people.  But rather than reexamine their religious messages, they’re doubling down — and hoping censorship will save the day. They’re banning books, stopping truthful discussions of our history and pushing religion in public schools — yet more unChristian displays of power.  The reality is, young people are open to faith and spirituality in some form. Fortunately, beneath the screams of far-right Christian extremists, there is a religious movement that supports progressive, inclusive policies, and it’s growing stronger.  For example, a few weeks ago, thousands of Catholic nuns wrote a letter calling for “the full inclusion of transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive individuals.” Many faith groups are also fighting against the scourge of gun violence.  At the school I lead, Union Theological Seminary (UTS), it’s clear that students are clamoring for faith practices that align with their progressive values. Our students — who identify with many different faith traditions, or as spiritual but not religious — are focused on dismantling racism, protecting our planet, supporting LGBTQ+ communities and other social justice goals.  All the while, they’re supported by the message of love and justice from the Bible and other sacred texts. This year alone, we’ve hosted a number of inclusive events, like an evening of singing to cultivate peace and harmony with renowned Buddhist Venerable Sister Chan Khong, a symposium to foster collaboration between Black churches and LGBTQ+ communities, and annual ceremonies to honor members of Union’s LGBTQ+ graduating student body.  Young people can see through the facade of restrictive policies clothed in the guise of religion. And thanks to them, we can move toward a world that God and the Bible actually ask us to build — a world of love, respect and acceptance. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nYoung people are overwhelmingly rejecting hate-filled biblical interpretations and restrictive policies in the name of religion. \nMany faith groups are fighting for progressive, inclusive policies and supporting LGBTQ+ communities. \nFar-right leaders are attempting to censor discussions and push religion in public schools. \nYoung people are looking for faith practices that align with their progressive values.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses how young people are rejecting the hate-filled biblical interpretations of far-right politicians and religious leaders.\nIt also highlights how young people are increasingly becoming religiously unaffiliated and how faith institutions are beginning to embrace progressive, inclusive policies.\nThe article concludes by emphasizing that young people are pushing for a world of love, respect and acceptance, which is what God and the Bible ask us to build."

        "text": "© Provided by The Nation  Confederate President Jefferson Davis has been yelling at me lately. Well, the person running a Twitter account in his name has been doing so. “Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne” has chimed in to call me a fraud, liar, and “an antisemitic activist on a mission to destroy history.” Other Confederates try to take a higher road: Since “anyone putting pronouns in their bio is broadcasting their cult indoctrination,” I should simply be ignored in favor of reading print-on-demand books with titles like Old Times There Should Not Be Forgotten: Cultural Genocide in Dixie.  Why the fervor? I had tweeted that Arlington National Cemetery has announced the removal of its Confederate Memorial. In 2021, as a response to the worldwide protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd, Congress required the Department of Defense to create a commission to consider the ways in which the military continued to honor the Confederacy. This January, the department announced that it had accepted this commission’s recommendations. The secretary of defense explained that the decision to “remove from U.S. military facilities all names, symbols, displays, monuments, and paraphernalia that honor or commemorate the Confederacy” had been taken so that these facilities could “inspire all those who call them home, fully reflect the history and the values of the United States, and commemorate the best of the republic that we are all sworn to protect.”  One of these recommendations is to remove portions of the Arlington Confederate Memorial. This memorial, dedicated in 1914, has a granite base and a bronze frieze of life-sized figures that present, according to the cemetery’s website, “a nostalgic, mythologized vision of the Confederacy, including highly sanitized depictions of slavery.” The frieze was intended to enshrine two cherished myths of the Lost Cause apologists by showing a Confederate soldier handing his baby to an enslaved nurse, who weeps to see him go, and an enslaved valet stoically marching alongside his master. These figures represent the supposed “loyal slaves,” who faithfully remained at home to care for soldiers’ wives and children during the war (because, presumably, they agreed that slavery was on the whole a good system), and the “Black Confederates” who fought for the South.  When I responded to this news by tweeting, “No more ‘loyal slave’ myths!,” I was admonished that these ideas are not mythical at all. My replies were full of information about Black men who fought for the South, and I was scolded for forgetting “these brave men [who] fought for their land.” All these claims have been thoroughly debunked, most recently by the historian Kevin M. Levin in his book Searching for Black Confederates: The Civil War’s Most Persistent Myth. Meanwhile, “Col. Joseph Hardin” (a Revolutionary War hero pinch-hitting for the Confederacy) doubted that I could explain “how the South was able to mobilize as many men as it did without loyal slaves manning the plantations.” As if there were no other possible reasons to explain the decisions of the people who kept working during the war.  The lies written in bronze on the Arlington Confederate Memorial are no mere historical curiosities, displaying now-discarded beliefs. Those beliefs are alive and well. No wonder the commission found that the picture presented by the memorial “distorts history” so thoroughly that it would be impossible to neutralize its effect by merely putting up contextualizing signage. While the members considered other options, such as “demolishing and recycling all components of the memorial,” they ultimately recommended removing the bronze elements, while “leaving the granite base and foundation in place to minimize risk of inadvertent disturbance of graves.”  Now, a coalition of Confederate heritage supporters have banded together and filed a lawsuit to #DefendArlington (their proposed hashtag, which has so far not trended on social media, but you can buy it on a T-shirt). The filing points out that the commission’s authorizing legislation instructed it to pay some attention to “local sensibilities” about changes and then trots out four plaintiffs whose sensibilities have supposedly been offended.  The lawsuit’s definition of “local” is loose, as only two of these plaintiffs seem ever even to have visited Arlington. One is a Confederate history tour guide and the other a descendant of some of the soldiers buried by the memorial. Another plaintiff lives in Alabama but believes that the memorial commemorates his Confederate ancestors buried in unmarked graves in other sites. Since the authorities plan merely to remove the bronze elements, leaving the massive granite base in place, there will still be plenty left for those who wish to visit Arlington’s Confederate section as a pilgrimage site (or just think on it). Indeed, there is nothing to stop the removed frieze from being redisplayed elsewhere—so the tour guide might be able to charge clients more for two stops. Besides, there’s plenty of interest for fans of the Confederacy at the cemetery, at whose center sits Arlington House, our national Robert E. Lee memorial.  The final plaintiff is Harold K. Edgerton, described in the filing as “a Confederate Southern American of African ancestry” who is “an active and vocal defender of Southern culture and history and the honor of the Confederate soldier both black and white.” The filing makes no claim that Edgerton has ever even thought about the Arlington memorial, but his inclusion is unsurprising. He is a prized member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans for the support his mere presence appears to give to the myth of Black Confederates. Levin, who has devoted special attention to Edgerton, argues that he is “peddling falsehoods refuted by countless historians of slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction.”  Instead of worrying about the “sensibilities” of those whose lives are lived in an antebellum fantasyland, the Department of Defense is admirably showing that it is concerned with the effect of objects like the Arlington Confederate memorial on living service members. Black Americans are overrepresented in the military. They have volunteered to serve our imperfect country. It is a poor return for that service to insist that they share their burial ground with a monument that not only praises those who thought they were superior to Black people, but also insists that Black Southerners agreed that their enslavement was for the best.  On Twitter, “President Davis” insisted to me that the memorial “has nothing to do with slavery in any way, shape or form.” The current lawsuit holds this point of view, as well, claiming that the monument “represents the reunification of the North and South.” Indeed, the filing insists three times that the monument is “commonly” or “oftentimes” referred to as the “Reconciliation Memorial.” I could not find a single example of that appellation used before the commission recommended the monument’s removal—another example of the neo-Confederates hoping that reality will change if they insist on it hard enough.  The plaintiffs point out that “[n]early every U.S. president in the modern era, including Barrack Obama, has laid a wreath of flowers at the Memorial as a tribute to the spirit of reconciliation and healing it represents.” (That’s “sic” on “Barrack,” by the way.) They don’t mention that Obama received heavy criticism for continuing the Memorial Day tradition of including the monument on the list of memorials to which the president dispatches aides to lay wreaths. Obama responded by continuing the tradition but also pointedly adding the African American Civil War Memorial to the list.  The fake Black Confederate on the Arlington memorial should no longer be given the same respect as the hundreds of thousands of real Black soldiers who fought for the Union. Many are buried in Arlington, with no monument beyond their headstones.  Showing that neo-Confederates have learned from protests in recent years, the lawsuit tries to co-opt rhetoric used by racial justice activists: We can’t tear down a monument that offers us a chance to “better understand the complex history of the United States,” can we? The response is that we have a surplus of object lessons about our complex history on view. A walk through D.C. neighborhoods, shaped by long histories of segregation, provides many such lessons. We are in no danger of forgetting when there are legacies much more difficult to change than a single monument.  The #DefendArlington crowd has another card up its sleeve: anti-Semitism. The Arlington memorial was sculpted by Moses Ezekiel, the first Jewish graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, who fought for the Confederates before he began a long career as an artist. The tweeting defenders insisted that supporting the removal of his work would be anti-Semitic. That such a sudden rallying to the cause of protecting a Jewish Confederate is just the slightest bit pretextual was suggested by the homophobic insults lobbed at me in the debate. Ezekiel, who never married, was circumspect about his sexuality, but it’s probably no accident that he relocated to Rome, summered at Capri, and spent 45 years in a close relationship with a male painter whom he immortalized in hunky drawings. I wonder if the Confederate flag comes in rainbow?  Ezekiel plays a big role in the lawsuit, not only for his Judaism (mentioned three times) but also because the filing claims that the entire memorial is his grave marker. If this is true, the commission could not recommend its removal, since grave markers were specifically excluded from its remit. The filing waxes near-poetic about Ezekiel’s burial “inches from the base of his Memorial without the traditional approved white marble headstone authorized for use in Arlington.” That’s true—Ezekiel has no white marble headstone. Instead, he has a hefty granite and bronze headstone. The plaintiffs somehow forget to mention that one, but I have plenty of photos from my recent trip to the memorial.  No amount of rebranding as the “Reconciliation Memorial” will transform this monument into anything other than the lying propaganda it has always been. We need both truth and reconciliation, not one or the other.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe Arlington National Cemetery has announced the removal of its Confederate Memorial in response to the worldwide protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd. \nA coalition of Confederate heritage supporters have filed a lawsuit to #DefendArlington, claiming that the memorial represents the reunification of the North and South.\nThe lawsuit includes a plaintiff of African ancestry who is an active defender of Southern culture and history, despite the fact that the myth of Black Confederates has been debunked.\nThe monument is a lying propaganda piece and cannot be transformed into anything other than what it is, and truth and reconciliation are both needed.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the controversy surrounding the removal of the Arlington Confederate Memorial, which was recommended by the Department of Defense in response to the worldwide protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd.\nA coalition of Confederate heritage supporters have filed a lawsuit to #DefendArlington, claiming that the memorial represents the reunification of the North and South.\nThe article also examines the myths of “loyal slaves” and “Black Confederates” that are perpetuated by the memorial, and the role of sculptor Moses Ezekiel in the controversy."

        "text": "An interview with audience members from CNN’s Wednesday town hall with former President Donald Trump backfired after CNN national correspondent Gary Tuchman asked a voter whether Trump was too focused on the 2020 election over 2024 during the event. Following CNN’s controversial town hall, Tuchman asked eight Republican and undeclared voters from the audience to raise their hands if they thought Trump looked better, worse, or the same following his performance that evening. All eight audience members indicated that their opinions on Trump had not changed. “Donald Trump, you have to be blunt about it, is not a truth-teller. That’s the way he’s always been when he was a businessman and when he’s been a politician,” said Tuchman. “He has lied about the 2020 election, stuffed ballot boxes; it’s all made up. He’s lost dozens of court cases.” “Does it bother you that he keeps talking about 2020 and not 2024?” he asked. “How do you feel about those lies?” The first audience member to answer, a 40-year-old Republican who voted for Trump twice, responded, “So, I feel like part of it is also the media narrative, as you guys asked him the first question at the town hall about the 2020 election rather than current stuff.” Asked again by Tuchman whether he thought it was time Trump started “talking about 2024 and not lies that aren’t true,” the audience member replied, “Couldn’t the media ask him a question about 2024?” “There were questions, but you’re right, that was the first thing,” Tuchman said. “But that’s something that was on our mind and that’s why it was asked first.” CNN host Kaitlan Collins opened the network’s town hall on Wednesday by repeatedly pushing Trump to admit that he lost the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden. Tuchman then spoke to a second audience member, who said he was “getting tired of hearing” Trump talk about the results of the 2020 election. “I’m very much more so interested in the problems that we face now, and I would prefer to hear him discuss the present issues more so than going to the past,” the voter said.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  Yesterday was Philadelphia's primary for its mayoral race. However, given that the city has not elected a Republican mayor since Harry Truman was president, barring some unforeseen miraculous events, the primary acts as the de facto general election for mayor. And yesterday's election was a bit of a stunning upset as former City Councilwoman Cherelle Parker won. She will most likely become Philadelphia's first black female mayor.  In the era of identity politics, Parker's victory is unquestionably historic. It also, once again, debunks many of the left-wing claims about \"white supremacy\" and anti-black racism being systemic in the city. But perhaps even more shocking was the political platform of Parker's campaign. In a city plagued with violent crime, she ran as a candidate who would be tough on crime, hire more police officers to patrol the streets, and support stop and frisk.  THE ALARMING LINK BETWEEN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND MARIJUANA  This is particularly noteworthy because stop and frisk was a tactic police used in which officers would temporarily detain a person they suspected of wrongdoing and search them with a pat-down frisk for weapons. The procedure was famously used in New York City during the city’s dramatic increase in crime. It led to a significant reduction in crime. Later, because many of the criminals arrested with stop and frisk were black men, many left-wingers repeatedly deemed it as racist and promoting anti-black discrimination. The fact that the city’s first black female mayor wants to implement it should be telling.  Additionally, Parker's victory is noteworthy for some of the candidates she defeated, most notably the radical extremist and borderline communist Helen Gym, supported and endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), as many predicted her victory. It would have been disastrous for the city.  It's hard to imagine how things could get worse in the city, a sentiment I can surely attest to after recently witnessing a drive-by shooting, but Gym as mayor would have done so. Between embracing radical economic and criminal justice policies and left-wing cultural values, the city wouldn't have survived. Her anticipated victory was a scary thought for every normal, sane, rational Philadelphia voter given the economic struggles, poverty, drug use, the opioid crisis, and rampant record-breaking crime over the last few years.  Thankfully, it’s a scenario the city won’t have to experience because Philadelphians voted for Parker. And while I preferred Republican primary winner David Oh, I also realize he has no legitimate shot at winning. This is especially true with a Democratic candidate campaigning on being tough on crime, as she emphasized on her campaign website. Hopefully, Parker sticks to her commitment, stays away from radical left-wing ideologies on criminal justice and social issues, and facilitates the change the city desperately needs when she takes over for arguably the worst mayor in recent history, largely responsible for the current mess, Jim Kenney.

        "text": "© Thomson Reuters U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at his final campaign event at the Devos Place in Grand Rapids, Michigan By Sarah N. Lynch WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The FBI lacked \"actual evidence\" to investigate Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and relied too heavily on tips provided by Trump's political opponents to fuel the probe, U.S. Special Counsel John Durham concluded in a report released on Monday. The report marks the end of a four-year probe launched in May 2019 when then-Attorney General William Barr appointed Durham, a veteran prosecutor, to probe potential missteps by the FBI when it launched its early stage \"Crossfire Hurricane\" inquiry into potential contacts between Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. That Crossfire Hurricane investigation would later be handed over to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in March 2019 concluded there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. In his new 306-page report, Durham concluded that U.S. intelligence and law enforcement did not possess any \"actual evidence\" of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia prior to launching Crossfire Hurricane. He also accused the bureau of treating the 2016 Trump probe differently from other politically sensitive investigations, including several involving Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. For instance, he said Clinton and other officials received defensive briefings about being the possible targets of foreign interference, whereas Trump received no such briefing before the FBI opened probes into four members of his campaign. \"The Department and the FBI failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law in connection with certain events and activities described in this report,\" Durham wrote. \"Senior FBI personnel displayed a serious lack of analytical rigor towards the information that they received, especially information from politically affiliated persons and entities.\" In response to the report, the FBI said it has already implemented dozens of corrective actions that have been in place for some time. Durham's report was released to Congress on Monday without redactions, after it was delivered to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Friday. House Judiciary Committee Republican Chair Jim Jordan said on Twitter he has invited Durham to testify about his report next week. Durham's findings are likely to become political fodder for Trump, who is planning to run for re-election in 2024 despite facing criminal charges in New York and two federal investigations by Special Counsel Jack Smith that are looking both at Trump's retention of classified records and his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. © Thomson Reuters Special Counsel John Durham departs after opening arguments in the trial of Attorney Michael Sussmann being held at the U.S. Federal Courthouse in Washington Trump had hoped Durham would release his report ahead of the 2020 election, in what he thought would be a blow to President Joe Biden's campaign. But Durham's investigation has largely failed to produce meaningful impact, after two separate juries acquitted both defendants he tried to prosecute in 2022. In one case Durham brought, a Washington, D.C. jury acquitted Hillary Clinton's former campaign attorney Michael Sussmann on charges he lied to the FBI when he met with the bureau in September 2016 to share a tip about possible communications between Trump's business and a Russian bank. Durham's investigation was dealt yet another major set-back just a few months later, when a jury in Virginia acquitted Russian researcher Igor Danchenko of charges that he lied to the FBI when he was interviewed about the sources of information he provided that became part of a document known as the \"Steele dossier.\" That document, penned by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, made allegations about ties between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia and contained salacious details - many of which were never substantiated. An investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general later found that the FBI improperly continued to rely on unsubstantiated allegations in the Steele dossier when it applied for court-approved warrant applications to monitor the communications of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. Durham did secure a successful guilty plea against former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, who was singled out in the inspector general's report, for altering an email that was used to justify a government wiretap application for Page. Durham's report on Monday echoed many of the concerns the inspector general previously raised about the rigor of the FBI's process for applying to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for wiretap applications.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nSpecial Counsel John Durham concluded that the FBI lacked \"actual evidence\" to investigate Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\nDurham accused the FBI of treating the 2016 Trump probe differently from other politically sensitive investigations.\nThe FBI secured a successful guilty plea against former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith for altering an email used to justify a government wiretap application.\nThe Justice Department's inspector general found that the FBI improperly continued to rely on unsubstantiated allegations in the Steele dossier.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nSpecial Counsel John Durham concluded in a report released on Monday that the FBI lacked \"actual evidence\" to investigate Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and relied too heavily on tips provided by Trump's political opponents to fuel the probe.\nDurham accused the FBI of treating the 2016 Trump probe differently from other politically sensitive investigations, including several involving Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\nThe report also echoed many of the concerns the Justice Department's inspector general previously raised about the rigor of the FBI's process for applying to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for wiretap applications.\nDurham secured a successful guilty plea against former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith for altering an email that was used to justify a government wiretap application for Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser."

        "text": "© Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images; Joe Raedle/Getty Images In this combination Donald Trump disembarks his plane \"Trump Force One\" at Aberdeen Airport on May 1, 2023 in Aberdeen and Donald Trump Jr.speaks during the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit held at the mage, Tampa Convention Center on July 23, 2022 in Tampa, Florida.  Donald Trump Jr. said his father has the \"charisma of a mortician and the energy that makes Jeb Bush look like an Olympian,\" in an apparent mistake while trying to take a shot at Ron DeSantis.  He made the comments during an episode of his podcast, 'Triggered with Donald Trump Jr., which was broadcast on Thursday via video streaming site Rumble.  DeSantis announced he's running for the Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday during a Twitter Spaces conversation with Elon Musk that was beset by technical difficulties, sparking widespread mockery. Polling indicates the Florida governor is Trump's most dangerous rival in the battle for the GOP nomination, though he has fallen back significantly in recent months.  Trump Jr. began his podcast with a monologue attacking DeSantis, branding him \"Ron DeStablishment\" and claiming he has a \"nasally and effeminate\" voice.  However Trump Jr. later insulted his own father, using language that appeared to be aimed at DeSantis. He commented: \"Trump has the charisma of a mortician and the energy that makes Jeb Bush look like an Olympian, the policies of a D.C. swamp rat.\"  A 17-second clip was posted on Twitter by Ron Filipkowski, an independent journalist who claims to monitor \"right-wing extremism,\" and who suggested he \"misreads his script.\"  Immediately after the remark, Trump Jr. went back to attacking DeSantis by name, commenting: \"We've seen the flip flops, you can pretend you're MAGA but Ron still can't answer what he'd do on Ukraine.\"  Newsweek has contacted Donald Trump Jr. for comment via an email sent to the Trump Organization media contact point.  During the episode, Trump Jr. also played a clip from the DeSantis Twitter Spaces discussion, when the audio played static noise after which someone can be heard whispering \"now it's quiet.\"  In response to the launch difficulties, which took place when DeSantis was supposed to be speaking with Musk and fellow business magnate David Sacks, \"DeSaster\" began trending nationally in the U.S.  Trump Jr. referenced this, commenting: \"As I said it was a #DeSaster and it took a long time for Elon Musk to apparently figure out what was going on, and it took two charismatic billionaires like Elon Musk and David Sacks to carry DeSantis through this, where he basically read like an op-ed about what he was going to do.\"  Speaking after his launch, DeSantis suggested the Twitter Spaces technical difficulties were caused by the level of interest in his announcement.  He said: \"We had a huge audience. It was the biggest they'd ever had. It did break the Twitter space. And so we're really excited with the enthusiasm, but ultimately it's about the future of our country.\"  Donald Trump was sharply critical on his Truth Social website, writing: \"Wow! The DeSanctus TWITTER launch is a DISASTER! His whole campaign will be a disaster.\"  The former president also shared a fake AI generated video mocking DeSantis by appearing to show him launching his campaign alongside George Soros, Adolf Hitler and the Devil.

        "text": "Tonight, CNN will host a live town hall featuring a twice-impeached, one-term former president who was just found liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered to pay $5 million to the victim. This is a man who continues to deny the results of the 2020 election, is under indictment for falsifying business records in New York, and is facing criminal investigations for election interference and for potential violations of the Espionage Act.  You might have heard of him — his name is Donald Trump and he's presently the far-and-away frontrunner for the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nomination.  Before blaming CNN for airing Trump town hall, consider that Republicans still support him  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  CNN has faced harsh and justified criticism for platforming a political figure who lies with hummingbird-wing frequency. That criticism has only grown since a federal jury on Tuesday found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. But pointing a finger at a news network’s callous and transparent play for ratings overlooks two crucial facts:  According to polling averages by Real Clear Politics and FiveThirtyEight, Trump is nearly 30 points ahead of the No. 2 choice, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to announce his candidacy. A new Morning Consult survey released Tuesday showed Trump with a 41-point lead on DeSantis. Trump is the frontrunner because a majority of Republicans want him to be. They like his cruelty. They have bought into the conspiracies and daily aggrieved-white-guy soap opera that undergirds the MAGA movement.  Republican lawmakers, time and again, have rejected opportunities to rid themselves of Trump and his toxicity. Had they voted to impeach him, he wouldn’t be able to run for office. Had they turned on him en masse over his election denialism, they could have saved themselves. They didn’t. In fact, at least 11 Republican senators and more than 50 Republican House members have already endorsed Trump’s 2024 primary campaign. House GOP Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, the No. 3 Republican in the House, put out a statement endorsing Trump right after the 2022 midterms: “Republican voters determine who is the leader of the Republican Party and it’s very clear President Trump is the leader of the Republican party.”  Most Republican voters are saying, 'Yes, we'd like that demonic force to be president again!'  We can complain all we want about CNN giving airtime to a political figure many, myself included, find repugnant, a person former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, in a text he never imagined would be seen by the world, called “a demonic force, a destroyer.” But that’s giving a pass to the Republican politicians and voters who have made it abundantly clear they want this demonic force to again be president. This is their guy. They want the destroyer.  Will DeSantis run or won't he?: With Trump gaining in the 2024 primary polls, it's go (or never go) time for DeSantis  Until a majority of Republicans show otherwise, Trump and everything he represents IS the Republican Party.  To me, that’s the story. Everyone has heard the former president's vile rhetoric and seen the childish, bullying attacks he launches not just on opponents but on members of his own party. DeSantis is supposed to be a rising star in conservative politics, but Trump for months now has been belittling him, questioning his accomplishments as governor and taunting him with nicknames.  © AP / Kaplan Hecker & Fink Former President Donald Trump gives a deposition in a civil case brought by E. Jean Carroll. On Tuesday, May 9, 2023, a federal jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation of Carroll in 1996 and said he should pay her $5 million in total damages.  'When you show that you are an insurrectionist, that you’re a liar, that you’re a bigot, that you’re a racist...'  We all know what kind of person Trump is because we’ve seen it with our own eyes and heard it with our own ears over and over and over again.  In a bizarre bit of media navel-gazing, here is Fox News’s website reporting on comments made on ABC’s “The View” regarding CNN’s decision to host a Trump town hall:  “CNN also took flack from ‘The View’ co-host Sunny Hostin for giving airtime to the former president, a decision that Hostin said made her feel ‘disgusted.’  E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit against Trump: We're reminded there's no right way to be raped  “‘[W]hen someone shows you who they are, you believe them,’ Hostin said of Trump. ‘When you show that you are an insurrectionist, that you’re a liar, that you’re a bigot, that you’re a racist, that you're sexist, that you’re twice impeached, that you’re currently a criminal defendant, and likely to be a criminal defendant in two other jurisdictions, and you grab women by their genitals, I know everything I need to know about you,’ she said.”  This is a bad, cruel man who has only his own interests at heart – and Republicans love him  That news-network turducken is all well and good, and I don’t disagree with Hostin’s assessment, but again, it misses the real story. Trump as a political figure exists only because there are enough Republicans out there willing to excuse the bigotry and racism and sexism and impeachments and criminal investigations and free-and-easy comments on sexual assault. He’s not a spectacle solely because CNN or any other media outlet makes him a spectacle.  He’s here, in the spotlight, because he — in all his democracy-eroding awfulness — is exactly what a sizable majority of Republican say they want in a political leader.  Blame CNN all you want, but spare at least one finger to point at the once-long-ago “party of personal responsibility.” GOP leaders and voters should be held responsible for their ongoing support and cult-like embrace of a political figure who disgraces himself and America every time he opens his mouth.  CNN isn’t the problem. Even Trump himself isn’t the problem.  The problem is that so many Republicans still, despite an ocean of evidence to the contrary, believe Donald Trump, of all the damn people in this world, is the solution. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nDonald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nomination.\nRepublicans have failed to reject Trump and his toxicity, with many endorsing his 2024 primary campaign.\nCNN has faced criticism for platforming Trump, but the real story is that a majority of Republicans still support him.\nRepublican leaders and voters should be held responsible for their ongoing support of Trump.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the fact that Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nomination, despite his numerous scandals and controversies.\nIt argues that the Republican Party and its voters are to blame for continuing to support Trump, and that CNN is not the only one responsible for giving him a platform.\nThe article concludes that the real problem is that many Republicans still believe Trump is the solution, despite the evidence to the contrary."

        "text": "© Tribune Content Agency Members of Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence participate in the I Cant Breathe- Silent March for Justice in front of the Hennepin County Government Center on March 7, 2021, where the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, charged with murdering African American man George Floyd, will begin on March 8, 2021, in Minneapolis.  The Left is waging a full-fledged cultural revolution against traditional America. And the Maoist results are often as absurd as they are terrifying.  Special-counsel John Durham just issued his final report on wrongdoing within the FBI, CIA, and the Department of Justice.  The summary confirms that our premier investigatory and intelligence agencies interfered in the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.  Directors and high-ranking FBI officials lied under oath. They misled Congress. They altered court documents and deceived federal judges.  The FBI hired a foreign national to gather dirt on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign – while he was being paid by the rival Hillary Clinton campaign.  The FBI contracted Twitter to suppress news stories. It kept the Hunter Biden laptop under wraps, even as former intelligence officials flat out lied it was likely “Russian disinformation.” That was a blatant effort to aid the 2020 Biden campaign.  © Provided by Tribune Content Agency Victor Davis Hanson  The IRS just conceded whistleblowers were correct and the agency fired its entire multi-year audit team responsible for investigating Hunter Biden’s purported tax irregularities.  The agency claimed it was ordered to do so by the Department of Justice, headed by Biden’s appointee Merrick Garland.  California is facing a crushing $32 billion deficit. Yet it flirts with an $800 billion-dollar “reparations” payout to the state’s Black residents.  No one has any idea where the money for that would come from. No one can define who would qualify. No one can explain why a state that never allowed slavery eight generations ago now owes selected Californians billions of dollars it does not have.  One of the reparations board leaders asserts Blacks might be willing to accept an “installment” plan of payments.  The NAACP just issued a “travel alert” advising Blacks not to visit Florida. The announcement was timed to draw negative attention to conservative Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ announcement of a presidential bid.  Chicago, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, and Indianapolis – all outside Florida – have the highest Black murder rates in the nation.  Florida by contrast, with a Black population of 3.3 million, has the second largest number of Black businesses in the nation. The chairman of the NAACP’s board of directors is himself a Florida resident!  Black Lives Matter has just announced it lost millions of dollars in investments and ran up huge deficits. The culprit was its former corrupt leadership.  Its extravagant spending, plush homes, and family hangers-on have nearly bankrupted the advocacy group. It cannot account for the millions of dollars in corporate guilt and protection money it leveraged following the George Floyd riots in 2020.  In New York, a threatening subway career criminal with 42 prior arrests was subdued by a bystander and died during the confrontation. The criminal is now deified. The would-be Samaritan is charged with felony manslaughter.  The deceased’s uncle is vocal about his late nephew’s confrontation. But he himself was just arrested with stolen property and armed with a knife. He was mysteriously still roaming the streets despite 70 prior arrests and current active arrest warrants.  In almost every American city and town, biological males, with enormous advantages in size and musculoskeletal mass, routinely win women’s sporting competitions.  They are systematically destroying decades of progress that sought to ensure parity between men and women’s sports.  Corporate America has joined this cultural revolution hysteria. Companies are apparently now hellbent on destroying their brands, profits, and net worth.  Under pressure from the LGBTQ activists, the Los Angeles Dodgers reinvited the “Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence” to celebrate Pride night at Dodger Stadium.  Catholics and Christians had objected to the invitation because the group’s notoriety hinges on its sexualized and often pornographic mockery of Catholic ritual, the Holy Trinity, and Christian faith.  The supposedly courageous group would never dare extend its street-theater blasphemy to other religious groups such as Muslims or Hindus.  The Dodgers apparently do not care that Greater Los Angeles may be home to 6 million Mexican American citizens and resident Hispanic immigrants. Most are Catholic and many were avid Dodger fans.  Anheuser-Busch has nearly destroyed its best-selling Bud Light brand by hiring transgender performance-art activist Dylan Mulvaney to hawk the brand – and his own transitioning – to America’s working classes.  The Disney corporation, for decades, has enjoyed multibillion-dollar concessions and a veritable 40-square mile private fiefdom gifted from the taxpayers of Florida.  No matter. Disney has rebranded it films, amusement parks, and television offerings to reflect radical transgender, gay, and race advocacies.  The results so far are billion-dollar losses in Disney stock, subscribers, and viewers.  A woke CNN has all but destroyed its once-global audience.

        "text": "Â© Provided by The Comeback Former president Donald Trump interacts with fans  This week, former United States President Donald Trump is visiting the golf courses he owns in Scotland. And while the appearance is jarring enough given that it comes amid his ongoing civil trial for rape as well as federal fraud charges, itâs also a reminder of just how much money he made from his international business while he was president.  According to an analysis of his tax returns by CREW, Donald Trump made up to $160 million from international business dealings while he was serving as president of the United States.  âThroughout his time in office, President Trump, his family and his Republican allies repeatedly assured the public that his refusal to divest from his businesses wouldnât lead to any conflicts of interest. Americans were promised that Trump would donate his salary, which he did, until maybe he didnâtâall while siphoning millions from taxpayers that more than offset his presidential pay. When it came to foreign conflicts of interest, Trump and his company pledged to pause foreign business. They did not,â Rebecca Jacobs and Robert Maguire wrote for CREW.  And as CREW reports, a large portion of that money came from the golf courses heâs visiting this week.  âTrump pulled in the most money from the United Kingdom, where his Aberdeen and Turnberry golf courses in Scotland helped him gross $58 million. Trumpâs now-defunct hotel and tower in Vancouver helped him pull in $36.5 million from Canada. Trump brought in more than $24.4 million from Ireland, home to his often-visited Doonbeg golf course, as well as $9.6 million from India, and nearly $9.7 million from Indonesia,â CREW reported.  Given Trumpâs recent visits to his golf courses, people were reminded of Trumpâs unethical business dealings this week.  Itâs safe to say people arenât too happy with the former president.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  In medieval times, it was believed that pregnancy and certain medical conditions were caused by the demons Incubus and Succubus that would invade the body during sleep. As bizarre as it may seem, the role of spiritual demons influencing human reproduction was recently championed by a medical group leader with other physicians standing nearby in nodding approval.  In a few months, a recently passed law will go into effect in Florida that would not only allow medical practitioners in Florida to espouse such dangerous myths and beliefs without recourse but also deny medical care based on personal beliefs — no matter how outrageous or wrong.  Yet, if a state-certified teacher used some of the writings of Pulitzer and Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, for example, speaking to high-school students about understanding community diversity and the impact on public health, that person could be subject to disciplinary action if a parent of a student in the class objects.  The regulation and practice of medicine have been held in high esteem by the public and scientific community for millennia. More than 2,000 years ago, Hippocrates framed principles of medical practice, which are foundational. At medical school graduations across the country, the Hippocratic Oath or its modifications will be recited stating that we shall care for all:  “If it is given me to save a life and save life wherever possible within reason; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty.”  In the U.S., there are rigorous standards for the educational curriculum of those in medicine. Students in health care must pass special exams and medical board standards to graduate, helping to ensure that the individual is competent in their discipline. For those training to be physicians, post-medical school rigorous residency and fellowship training occurs, and exams to certify competency in the specific specialty. To practice in specific states, the individual will undergo a review of their credentials and need to satisfy licensing requirements. In circumstances where practitioners are employed by hospitals and health care systems, additional measures may need to be satisfied for that individual to practice. This rigorous process helps ensure that the public will be cared for by a competent practitioner following typical standards of care.  During the pandemic, at a time when the public was clamoring for COVID-19 treatments, nonproven interventions including hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were proposed for use by some members of the medical community. Surprisingly, even in the face of clinical studies showing their lack of efficacy and potential harm, some physicians continued to advocate for their use, provoking critical comments from the Food and Drug Administration and different medical societies.  The anti-vaccine stance of some physicians also drew the ire of the collective medical community. Leading medical organizations have advocated for licensing and credentialing bodies to take action against those giving potentially harmful advice publicly. In some circumstances, the conduct of physicians was referred to state medical boards. In some states, legislation was passed authorizing the potential discipline of physicians making inaccurate and potentially harmful statements related to COVID-19 care. However, such legislation was often challenged by members of the medical community and legally overturned.  In other states, we have seen a very different approach in which medical boards and credentialing authorities are prohibited from taking action against a physician for publicly stating things that are incorrect and at variance with standard medical practice, under the guise of protecting physician free speech.  In medicine, one cares for the patient in front of them irrespective of race, gender, gender identity, immigration status or political views. However, tied in with the notion of protecting physicians’ free speech is now the notion that medical practitioners have the option of not providing care based on their own personal beliefs. This has made its way into legislation in the form of so-called physician “right of conscience” bills in several states that go beyond bills related to abortion.  Some of these bills specifically state that practitioner care may not be denied based on race, religion, or sex, but many legislators do not consider gender identity in their definition of sex, a belief that is at variance with federal law. Thus, care could be denied based on a person’s gender identity or the practitioner’s view of the patient’s lifestyle practices. At a time when we are facing major shortages in the healthcare sector across the country, and alternate care providers are not available, this may lead to denied healthcare access.  We also need to recognize that this type of legislation is being introduced at a time when restrictions are being placed on the classroom discussion of topics related to diversity, inclusion, race and lifestyle. Under the guise of trying to protect children from exposure to material of sexual or lifestyle nature, we are seeing educational censorship and books being banned in school and public libraries, including writings by renowned authors.  It is interesting that a very small number of individuals are behind such national efforts. Almost daily, we are also learning of teachers being disciplined or brought before educational boards after objections from a parent, including objections to a Disney movie with a gay character being shown in a classroom, students being shown images of Michelangelo’s sculpture David or restrictions placed on a poem read at President Biden’s inauguration.  Individuals who think that they can control what children are exposed to by banning books in schools, especially at a time when fewer children are reading, need to realize that children are exposed to hours of unregulated social media and internet content daily. Fifteen percent of children 10 years and younger and 50 percent of those younger than 13 years have seen pornography online. The impact of this exposure has recently led the U.S. surgeon general to issue an advisory about social media use by children.  Historically, medical professionals have been among the most revered and respected members of society and those who we turn to in times of greatest need. In part, this is due to how we regulate and practice medicine.  We now must ask ourselves what the consequences will be when there are no guardrails to protect the public against false and harmful information from physicians who have a large social media megaphone. And why do we think it is so harmful to members of our incredibly diverse society to be exposed to literature and art and have teachers be penalized for doing so when children are exposed to hours of uncontrolled social media and internet content per day?  Why should a physician be allowed to preach and practice medicine believing in Incubus and Succubus, but teachers are not allowed to discuss the writings of Toni Morrison with students?  Scott A. Rivkees, M.D. is a professor of practice at the Brown University School of Public Health. He is the former state surgeon general and secretary of health of Florida. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nA recently passed law in Florida will allow medical practitioners to espouse dangerous myths and beliefs without recourse.\nRigorous standards are in place to ensure that the public is cared for by competent practitioners.\nPhysician “right of conscience” bills in several states allow practitioners to deny care based on personal beliefs.\nTeachers are being disciplined for discussing topics related to diversity, inclusion, race and lifestyle.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the potential consequences of a recently passed law in Florida that would allow medical practitioners to espouse dangerous myths and beliefs without recourse and deny medical care based on personal beliefs.\nIt also examines the contrast between the rigorous standards for medical practitioners and the censorship of teachers discussing topics related to diversity, inclusion, race and lifestyle.\nThe article concludes by questioning why physicians should be allowed to preach and practice medicine believing in Incubus and Succubus, but teachers are not allowed to discuss the writings of Toni Morrison with students."

        "text": "© Alex Brandon/AP Attorney Eric Schnapper with Beatriz and Jose Gonzalez, the parents of 23-year-old Nohemi Gonzalez, a student killed in the Paris terrorist attacks. The family wants to sue Google for YouTube videos they said helped attract and radicalize ISIS recruits. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)  The Supreme Court ruled for Google and Twitter in a pair of closely watched liability cases Thursday, saying families of terrorism victims had not shown the companies helped foster attacks on their loved ones.  “Plaintiffs’ allegations are insufficient to establish that these defendants aided and abetted ISIS in carrying out the relevant attack,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a unanimous decision in the Twitter case. The court adopted similar reasoning in the claim against Google.  The court’s narrowly focused rulings sidestepped requests to limit a law that protects social media platforms from lawsuits over content posted by their users, even if the platform’s algorithms promote videos that laud terrorist groups. That law, Section 230, has emerged as a lightning rod in the politically polarized debate over the future of online speech, as tech companies come under increased pressure to police offensive, harmful and violent posts on their platforms.  The court’s decision was a victory for tech companies and their surrogates, which have been running extensive lobbying and advocacy campaigns to defend Section 230 in Washington. Changes to the law, they say, could open a floodgate of litigation that would squash innovation and make it impossible for many popular websites to operate.  The claim against Google specifically focused on whether Section 230 protects recommendation algorithms. Tech companies said any novel interpretations of the legal shield could have wide-ranging effects on the technology that underlies almost every interaction people have online, from innocuous song suggestions on Spotify to prompts to watch videos about conspiracy theories on YouTube.  “Countless companies, scholars, content creators and civil society organizations who joined with us in this case will be reassured by this result,\" Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado said in a statement. \"We’ll continue our work to safeguard free expression online, combat harmful content, and support businesses and creators who benefit from the internet.”  Section 230 has been denounced by politicians from both parties who are increasingly concerned over the power that tech companies have over what posts and videos people see online.  Democrats, wary of the ways social media has been weaponized to spread falsehoods about elections and public health, want to change the provision to ensure that tech companies have more responsibility for harmful and offensive content on their websites. Republicans are concerned that Section 230 protects companies from lawsuits over decisions to remove content or suspend accounts, especially since the companies took the historic step of suspending Donald Trump and individuals involved in the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. (Meta, YouTube and Twitter have reinstated the former president’s account in recent months).  It was clear at oral arguments that the justices were reluctant to make significant changes to the law. “We’re a court,” Justice Elena Kagan said at the time, adding that she and her colleagues \"are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet.”  In the Twitter case, American relatives of Nawras Alassaf said the company failed to properly police its platform for Islamic State-related accounts in advance of a Jan. 1, 2017, attack at the Reina nightclub in Turkey that killed Alassaf and 38 others. In the Google case, the family of an exchange student killed in an Islamic State attack in Paris said Google’s YouTube should be liable for promoting content from the group.  The relatives in both cases based their lawsuits on the Anti-Terrorism Act, which imposes civil liability for assisting a terrorist attack. At issue was whether the company provided substantial assistance to the terrorist group.  But Thomas, writing in the Twitter case, said the link was too attenuated.  “As alleged by plaintiffs, defendants designed virtual platforms and knowingly failed to do ‘enough’ to remove ISIS-affiliated users and ISIS related content — out of hundreds of millions of users worldwide and an immense ocean of content — from their platforms,” he wrote. “Yet, plaintiffs have failed to allege that defendants intentionally provided any substantial aid to the Reina attack or otherwise consciously participated in the Reina attack — much less that defendants so pervasively and systemically assisted ISIS as to render them liable for every ISIS attack.”  © Ozan Kose/AFP/Getty Images Relatives of Ayhan Arik, one of the victims of the Reina night club attack, mourn at his funeral ceremony on January 1, 2017 in Istanbul. Thirty-nine people, including many foreigners, were killed early on January 1, 2016 when a gunman went on a rampage at an exclusive nightclub in Istanbul where revellers were celebrating the New Year. / AFP PHOTO / OZAN KOSEOZAN KOSE/AFP/Getty Images  The Google case specifically raised the issue of Section 230. But the short, unsigned decision said the justices “decline to address the application of Section 230 to a complaint that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief.”  The statute was enacted in 1996, years before YouTube, Facebook and other social networks existed. It has proved a potent legal shield for the companies, who regularly use it to seek the dismissal of lawsuits. Both Trump and President Biden and former president Donald Trump have criticized Section 230, at times calling for it to be revoked.  Despite a flurry of congressional hearings, however, there’s been little consensus among lawmakers about how to change it.  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said that the court’s decisions on Thursday put the onus back on Congress to take action.\"One reason [they declined to take it up] might be that they want the Congress to do our job,\" Cornyn said in a brief interview. “It’s a complex issue and I hope we take them up on it.”  Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who co-wrote Section 230 as a member of the House nearly three decades ago and filed a brief in its defense in these cases, said he appreciated the court’s “thoughtful rulings that even without Section 230, the plaintiffs would not have won their lawsuits.”  “Despite being unfairly maligned by political and corporate interests that have turned it into a punching bag for everything wrong with the internet, the law … remains vitally important to allowing users to speak online,\" Wyden said in a statement.  Tech industry-funded groups also celebrated the court’s decision. Chamber of Progress, which receives funding from Meta, Google and other companies and filed a brief supporting Google in the case, called the ruling an “unambiguous victory for online speech and content moderation.”  “While the Court might once have had an appetite for reinterpreting decades of Internet law, it was clear from oral arguments that changing Section 230’s interpretation would create more issues than it would solve,” said Jess Miers, a lawyer for the group.  Even some legal experts who submitted briefs in support of the Gonzalez family said they were pleased with the Supreme Court’s opinion. Mary Anne Franks, the president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, had called for the court to more narrowly interpret Section 230, after she argued lower courts had used it wrongly.  But she said that the justices’ opinion in the Twitter case shows that such litigation can be decided in the regular course of the law, taking “the wind out of the sails” of industry arguments that companies need a dedicated shield to protect them from “bad” lawsuits.  She also said the ruling provides a “green light” to Congress to move forward.  “It does clear up some of the underbrush when it comes to section 230 reform,” she said. “If we were holding off to see what court might do, the court has answered.”  The cases are Twitter v. Taamneh and Gonzalez v. Google.

Pictured: Present day  The timelapse clip features a total of 226 images that showcase how Brendan's physical appearance noticeably changed over a period of eight months.  Speaking of the project, they said: 'I've done video production and timelapse photography for a while, so I've had a lot of fun putting these time lapses together and seeing people enjoy them.  'The main reason trans people share timelines of their changes with HRT online is that people who are considering starting often go looking to see \"what will it do to me? I want to find someone who looked like me when they started.\"  'Many timelines don't start with a person who looks fairly masculine and still has a beard, so I felt it was important to have it start from the beginning.  'I've gotten messages from people telling me that my video gave them the confidence to start HRT and that's very special.  'I wish I had had a video like this while I was figuring stuff out.'  Brendan, who is originally from the UK but moved to America when they were two, has not socially transitioned yet, which is one of the reasons they are using their birth name.  Due to medical costs related to physically transitioning, Brendan will not be undergoing any surgery in the foreseeable future but plans on getting laser hair removal.  © Provided by Daily Mail The 23-year-old (pictured during the process) decided to document their journey to give other trans people the 'confidence to start HRT'  © Provided by Daily Mail The 23-year-old (pictured during the process) decided to document their journey to give other trans people the 'confidence to start HRT'  What is feminizing hormone therapy? Feminizing hormone therapy is typically used by transgender women and nonbinary people to produce physical changes in the body that are caused by female hormones during puberty. This hormone therapy, also called gender-affirming hormone therapy, helps better align the body with a person's gender identity. Feminizing hormone therapy involves taking medicine to block the action of the hormone testosterone. It also includes taking estrogen which lowers the amount of testosterone the body makes. Feminizing hormone therapy can be done alone or along with feminizing surgery. Not everybody chooses to have feminizing hormone therapy. It can affect fertility and sexual function, and it might lead to health problems. Source: Mayo Clinic  Brendan said: 'Physical changes take a few months to really show up and they're very minor at first.  'They are also contingent on having decent levels of estrogen and suppressed testosterone, among other things.'  The keen photographer said it took about four months before their bloodwork came back with good levels that mimic female puberty, adding: 'My medical transition is basically just HRT, which is more common than you would think for trans people.'  Brendan has said that their experience as a trans person has been mainly positive.  'The most surprising thing has been how supportive people have been, both online and in person.  'Most of my friends and immediate family know and no one has really taken it badly.  'Being in a somewhat conservative part of Florida I was expecting more negativity.  'Even online, the TikTok algorithm has been very good at not showing my videos to too many transphobes.  'My comments sections are overwhelmingly positive and that surprised me,' they explained.  However, Brendan does have concerns over the local government passing bills and legislation that could limit access to medicine and physical resources for trans people.  They said: 'Desantis, the governor of Florida, has been ramping up attacks on transgender people in the medical board of Florida and with bills that aim to limit access to gender-affirming care.  'Minors already have a lot of barriers in the way of getting gender-affirming care even in states where the legislation is kind to them. So here it is almost impossible.  'DeSantis already got all trans healthcare taken off of Medicaid in the state of Florida, essentially banning it for the poor.  © Provided by Daily Mail Brendan, a video journalist, said: 'The most rewarding part of my transition has been being able to share it with people and make a little piece of art out of it'  'He is looking to get private insurance to stop covering it and to put restrictions on who can prescribe treatment.  'They're also about to pass a 'bathroom bill' which will ban trans people from using bathrooms in buildings that receive state funding.  'I didn't expect these changes to come so quickly and at some point in the near future it might make it necessary for me to leave the state.  'For me personally, as a transfeminine person, transitioning using estradiol and testosterone blockers my medications are not scheduled substances, so it would be fairly easy for me to order them from reputable pharmacies overseas and import them.

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Marjorie Taylor-Greene  Marjorie Taylor Greene pushes to impeach the director of the FBI: The Georgia Congresswoman, who has been trying for more than a year to impeach President Biden, has added FBI director Christopher Wray to her hit list.  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  Marjorie Taylor Greene: A New Impeachment Idea  Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has been trying to impeach President Biden since the day after he took office, introducing legislation on January 21, 2021, to impeach Biden for “abuse of power by enabling bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors.”  Green introduced more articles of impeachment later in 2021, citing both the withdrawal from Afghanistan and “his violations of immigration law causing a national security crisis on our Southern border.”  Greene has re-introduced impeachment resolutions in the current Congress as well.  Greene hasn’t stopped with Biden and has now introduced articles of impeachment against FBI Director Christopher Wray.  According to Fox News, Greene wants to impeach Wray because of his part in \"the development of a Federal police force to intimidate, harass, and entrap American citizens that are deemed enemies of the Biden regime.\"  An example was the raid on former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate last year, as part of the inquiry into the ex-president’s handling of classified documents.  None of the previous impeachment efforts by Greene against various officials have gone anywhere, and it would appear to be part of the Congresswoman’s nonstop efforts to draw attention to herself by acting as outlandish a manner as possible.  And this has included an endless series of attempts to impeach the president and different administration officials.  Marjorie Taylor Greene, who already introduced a resolution to impeach Attorney General Merrick Garland after the Mar-a-Lago raid, has also announced her intention to impeach U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves of Washington, D.C. Greene was also a cosponsor on a 2021 resolution to impeach Secretary of State Antony Blinken, which mostly focused on the withdrawal from Afghanistan.  “In his conduct as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend, the Constitution of the United States, Christopher Asher Wray continues to materially endanger the justice system of the United States and empower President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., to persecute his political adversaries at will,” the full text of the impeachment resolution says.  The resolution lists no cosponsors.  In a statement, Greene also cited a “terrorist threat tag” introduced by the FBI after the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and an FBI document that cites “Radical-Traditionalist Catholics.” She referenced the raid on the home of Pennsylvania anti-abortion activist Matthew Houck, who was accused of pushing a 72-year-old abortion clinic volunteer. Houck was acquitted at trial in January.  “Not only has Director Wray persecuted political opponents in an unprecedented and partisan way, but he has also overseen his agency take actions to shield and protect the current President and his family. A senior FBI official left the agency under a cloud of accusations that he shielded a laptop belonging to the President’s son, Robert Hunter Biden, from a criminal probe,” the document said.  Greene’s document is full of half-truths, especially in claiming a double standard in how the Trump and Biden documents probes were handled. But Wray did nothing to block the Biden probe, which is currently being investigated by a special counsel.  While most of the targets of Greene-led impeachment efforts have been Biden appointees, Christopher Wray was appointed FBI director by Trump himself, in 2017, after Trump’s controversial firing of James Comey. Wray, however, soon found himself at odds with Trump on various fronts, and Biden kept Wray on when he came into office.  Earlier this week, Greene said that women who Hunter Biden paid for sex might be brought before the House Oversight Committee, on which she serves.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner Former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James Comey gestures while addressing a gathering at Harvard University's Institute of Politics' JFK Jr. Forum in Cambridge, Mass., Monday, Feb. 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)  Fired FBI Director James Comey has been out and about promoting his third work of fiction, Central Park West, a novel the Washington Post described as a “flaccid thriller.” His previous flights of fancy, A Higher Loyalty and Saving Justice: Truth, Transparency, and Trust, were released in 2018 and 2021, respectively.  Asked to weigh in on special counsel John Durham's report on MSNBC earlier this week, Comey declared there was \"nothing new\" in the report and maintained the lie that political bias played no role in the FBI’s investigation into former President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.  ONE QUESTION FOR TRUMP COULD DETERMINE THE RACE FOR THE 2024 GOP NOMINATION  \"In complex investigations, there’s always going to be mistakes. It doesn’t mean the FBI isn’t competent, honest, and independent,\" Comey said.  He said he considers calls to defund the FBI from GOP leaders to be “just a continuing series of attacks on the rule of law. They're taking a flamethrower to the FBI and DOJ, because it's a threat.”  Unsurprisingly, this arrogant and dishonest man went on to say that Trump “poses a near-existential threat to the rule of law. He will do everything he can in a new term to try to tear down the institutions that he sees as threats and to dismantle them and the people who occupy them, the apolitical people who occupy them. So there is a lot on the ballot in 2024 if he is a candidate, but the rule of law, in my view, is at the top of the list.”  Time has a way of erasing or at least diminishing the gravity of historical events. Let’s take a look at some of Comey’s deeds as the director of the country’s premier law enforcement agency. He greenlighted and helped orchestrate the greatest political dirty trick in modern history.  His agents presented British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s “unverified and salacious” dossier to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court as the basis for a warrant to spy on a U.S. citizen. We learned from Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s December 2019 report that, following a January 2017 FBI interview with Igor Danchenko, Steele’s primary subsource, Comey knew the stories were bogus, but he pressed on with his treasonous charade anyway. He signed off on two additional warrant applications, using the dossier as the “central and essential” justification.  The Durham report states that on Aug. 3, 2016, then-President Barack Obama and his national security team were briefed on the plan from the Hillary Clinton campaign to use the bogus dossier to deflect from the growing scandal around her use of a private server as secretary of state by then-CIA Director John Brennan. Comey was present at that meeting.  Moreover, a month later, Brennan repeated this information to Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok in a CIA investigative referral.  Nevertheless, Comey signed off on three applications to the FISA court that hid the fact that the dossier was opposition research paid for by Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The FBI also omitted information about Steele’s intense animosity toward Trump, as well as exculpatory evidence for junior campaign aides Carter Page and George Papadopoulos.  To top it all off, the FBI used journalist Michael Isikoff’s Sep. 23, 2016, Yahoo News article to corroborate the dossier, knowing all the while that Steele had been Isikoff’s source. These were not mistakes — they were deliberate deceptions.  Additionally, after the election, Comey used meetings with the new president as opportunities to set Trump up for potential crimes. He claimed, for example, that Trump’s request to leave then-national security adviser Michael Flynn alone constituted obstruction of justice.  And after Comey’s well-deserved firing, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, angry that Trump had publicized a memo he had written that outlined why the FBI director should be fired, appointed a special counsel to investigate him for colluding with the Russians to win the election and obstruction of justice. Why Rosenstein has managed to escape scrutiny has always baffled me.  It should be noted that both Comey and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page have testified under oath that, in May 2017, the FBI had no evidence of collusion.  Comey, in partnership with the Clinton campaign, used the agency he led to rig a presidential election. His decision to weaponize a once highly revered institution against a political candidate (and then president) whom he despised has shattered the public’s trust in the FBI and inflicted irreparable damage on the United States.  But despite overwhelming evidence of his corruption (and that of his colleagues), Comey continues to dismiss conclusive evidence of the FBI’s and his own culpability. When the first allegations of Comey’s malfeasance began to surface in 2018, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich humorously compared “Comey’s behavior to a child who throws a baseball at a car and then tries to pin the blame on his cousin.”  The truth is that Comey surrendered his right to say Trump “poses a near-existential threat to the rule of law” a long time ago. And rather than making the rounds to hawk his latest book, this fraud of a man should be hiding his face from the public in shame for the damage he’s wrought.

        "text": "© provided by AlterNet Image via screengrab.  Parents in Chattanooga, Tennessee boldly confronted the Hamilton County School Board and its Superintendent Justin Robertson on Sunday \"for caving to Moms (Against) Liberty-led bullying and canceling a librarian’s Mother's Day lesson inclusive to kids without moms,\" The Tennessee Holler tweeted.  Moms for Liberty (which the paper dinged as \"against\") is a right-wing organization that campaigns against social progress and civil rights. Media Matters for America pointed out in November 2021 that the non-profit has deep connections to the Republican Party and \"has county-specific chapters across the country that target local school board meetings, school board members, administrators, and teachers.\" Moms for Liberty also promoted \"stripping districts of protective COVID-19 measures\" and seeks to \"modify classroom curriculum to exclude the teaching of 'critical race theory' (CRT) and sex education, all in the name of 'parental rights.'\"  Last Tuesday, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press, Alpine Crest Elementary School librarian Caroline Mickey posted a letter on Moms for Liberty's website stating that \"With Mother's Day approaching, I'd like to highlight this special role, but I am sensitive to the fact that not all students live with a mother. As such, I am planning a lesson that celebrates those who fill the motherly roles in our lives.\"  Then, on Wednesday, ABC News Channel 9 explained that Mickey's event was \"designed to include students who didn't have what is considered a 'traditional' mother. But the group Hamilton County Moms for Liberty said the books promoted what they call the 'homosexual agenda.'\"  READ MORE: 'How do we not feel shame?' Tennessee Democrat hammers Republicans over inaction on guns  The outlet also noted that \"Moms for Social Justice has started a petition to bring back the Mother's Day course\" and that the board's decision sparked widespread outrage in the community and garnered national attention — which leads to the video shared by The Tennessee Holler over the weekend.  In it, several parents excoriate the school board for kowtowing to Moms for Liberty's demands. They held nothing back.  Mom number one:  The books that were to be shared have been accessible at Alpine Crest Elementary for nearly a decade and are logged and online. These books are well known for tackling blended families, adopted families, foster families, or any family that doesn't fit perfectly into a box. All students, families, and educators deserve to be respected and feel valued.  Mom number two:  I'm extremely disappointed in the way an inclusive Mother's Day lesson was canceled, and my kids' librarian has been vilified. I knew there would be pushback from a few loud bullies, but I'm enraged that the administration sided with them. A majority of families have been denied an important lesson in our increasingly diversified world, and a platform was given to a group of fear-mongering extremists. This group claims that a story about a bear is pushing trans ideology, and a story about a girl feeling left out during Mother's Day is pushing a homosexual agenda. They say this is 'sexualization of children' when they're the only ones that brought sex into it. The only agenda I'm seeing play out is that of Moms for Liberty, a well-funded and connected political group that prays on vulnerable people with manufactured outrage and the guise of protecting children. I'm here right now to protect my children from them. I'd have to strongly disagree that this group cares about the safety of all kids. The motivation behind the cancellation of a compassionate literacy lesson sends a message to minorities and LGBTQ families that their existence is unacceptable. By shielding your kids from love that looks different than yours, you're turning them into bullies and crippling them from living successfully in a diverse world.

We're here in the trenches. We're here with these children. This is 2023. I'm a Christian man, married to a woman, but I think everyone should be represented fairly. If you want to keep your kids in a closet and just shelter them from everything, homeschool them. Send them to Christian school. This is a public school for everyone. Everyone. I've dealt with that woman. She loves these kids.  Mom number three:  Instead of backing Mrs. Mickey up, you let the bullies win. When you let the bullies win, they're going to keep bullying. I understand that these adult bullies have intimidated and incited an ungodly amount of hate in our community. But you HCS leadership and admin must show them that you have a zero-tolerance policy for bullying. When you have a board policy that states you expect all students to treat each other with civility and respect, and then you let grown adults bully one of your educators, and you let them interrupt the education of our students, you're teaching the community that you don't actually mean what you say. What about my right? Why wasn't my voice heard before you decided to cancel this lesson? I'll finish with this. My child repeats this pledge at school every day. I'm respectful. I'm responsible. I'm caring. I'm ready to learn. I have tiger pride. You know what other lesson Alpine Crest students learn? Don't be a bystander, be an upstander and support and protect your peers against bullying. I think HCS leadership and admin would benefit from learning that lesson. Let's hope you don't decide to cancel that one too.  Watch the footage below or at this link.

        "text": "© Provided by Axios Sneak Peek  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) quietly cut a deal for Democrats to vote to advance the bipartisan debt ceiling bill to a final vote, according to four Democratic lawmakers briefed on the matter.  Why it matters: The 52 Democratic votes were necessary for the bill to clear a procedural hurdle after 29 Republicans voted against moving it to last night's final vote, in which it was approved 314-117.  The GOP resistance in the procedural \"rules\" vote was an unusual breach of norms — typically the majority party alone is considered responsible for putting a bill on the floor on the rules vote.  If Democrats hadn't stepped in, last night's final vote to move toward avoiding a catastrophic default by the U.S. government, it would have ground the effort to a halt.  What we’re hearing: The details of the deal have been tightly held, but a source said they expect more details to be made available soon.  The deal involves boosting federal spending set aside for projects in Democrats’ districts, what’s known as earmarks or “community project funding,” according to two senior lawmakers.  One lawmaker said the deal boosts earmarks to Democrats to bring them \"closer to parity\" with what Republicans receive in such funds in the GOP-led House.  What they're saying: McCarthy told reporters he did not cut a deal to supply the Democratic votes.  Jeffries tweeted: “House Democrats to the rescue to avoid a dangerous default and help House Republicans get legislation over the finish line that they negotiated themselves.”  The backdrop: Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, previously had told Democrats that they would receive significantly reduced funding for projects in their districts this year, according to Politico.  What we’re watching: The deal could further inflame far-right lawmakers already incensed about the compromise bill that McCarthy cut with Biden. They've accused the speaker of caving to most of Democrats’ demands and not cutting enough government spending.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) cut a deal for Democrats to vote to advance the bipartisan debt ceiling bill to a final vote.\nThe deal involved boosting federal spending set aside for projects in Democrats’ districts, and McCarthy denied cutting a deal to supply the Democratic votes.\nThe deal could further inflame far-right lawmakers already incensed about the compromise bill that McCarthy cut with Biden, as they accuse him of not cutting enough government spending.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries cut a deal for Democrats to vote to advance the bipartisan debt ceiling bill.\nThe deal involves boosting federal spending set aside for projects in Democrats’ districts.\nHouse Republicans negotiated the legislation themselves, but needed Democratic votes to pass it.\nFar-right lawmakers are angry about the compromise bill, accusing McCarthy of caving to Democrats' demands."

        "text": "© Provided by The Telegraph An electric vehicle being charged  The rollout of electric cars isn’t quite going to plan, is it? By the end of the decade it will be illegal to buy a new petrol car, but that doesn’t mean we’ve thought through the consequences.  There were always obvious problems with the technology: the electricity has to come from somewhere, and Britain isn’t installing enough chargers to meet government targets. And that’s before you take the rocketing price of electricity into account, which means that thousands of the handy roadside chargers where motorists could charge up for nothing have been pulled. There are nearly 40 per cent fewer than a year ago.  It now turns out that some bridges may not be able to take the weight of electric cars which, due to their large battery packs, are heavier than their petrol equivalents. Cue lengthy detours to a sturdier crossing point. It’s little use having new technology without the infrastructure to match.  Then there are the problematic metals the batteries contain. The environmental effects of mining them go on the debit side of the cost-benefit audit of electric cars.  A further issue is what happens when an electric car hits a pedestrian or a cyclist. Because they’re so heavy, the impact can be worse than that of a normal car. Urban 4x4s used to get a bad press because they could flatten pedestrians like a tank, but an electric car can do the same. Because they’re so quiet – unless they come with the fake engine noises manufacturers are working on – people might not hear them coming.  Moreover, if you’re remotely paranoid about surveillance technology when it comes to some social media apps or your smartphone, it turns out that some smart electric cars can collect data including route history and road speed. All the cameras, sensors, internet connectivity and radar which make the latest models so covetable also mean that they could theoretically be used for remote surveillance. I bet James Bond would pass on the electric vehicle and stick with the Aston Martin.  This doesn’t actually affect me. I cannot drive, and whenever possible travel by train. If I had my way, Britain would be dealing with the transport challenges of the future by reversing the Beeching cuts of the Sixties and reopening every tiny branch station in the country. But even I can see that this wouldn’t come cheap. What I take issue with is the way you can’t even discuss the problems with electric cars without getting jumped on.  Every new transport development does have its teething problems. Consider, for instance, the accidents during the early decades of the railways. The most spectacular was the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879, when the railway bridge collapsed in a gale under the passenger train to Dundee, killing everyone on board. The tragedy did occasion what is widely held to be the worst poem in the English language, William McGonagall’s The Tay Bridge Disaster. The immortal verse starts:  Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silv’ry Tay!  Alas! I am very sorry to say  That ninety lives have been taken away  On the last Sabbath day of 1879,  Which will be remember’d for a very long time.  I don’t think any current poet can equal this. So in the awful event of an electric car bridge tragedy, maybe the Poet Laureate could rise to the occasion?

        "text": "© John Bazemore-Pool/Getty Images U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene speaks during a court trial on April 22, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia. Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene has dismissed theories investigated by authorities that the Texas shooter might have been motivated by white supremacist and neo-Nazi beliefs, saying that only \"dumb white people\" would believe that a non-white person would advocate white supremacy. Last Saturday afternoon, a man shot and killed at least eight people, including children, at an outlet mall in Allen, Texas. He was killed by police at the scene, and later identified by authorities as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia, of Dallas. Garcia, who was wearing a tactical vest and was armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and a handgun, was a security guard and a former U.S. Army trainee. His security guard license had reportedly expired in 2020. While the suspect's death makes it harder for the police to identify the motive behind the rampage, authorities are considering Garcia might have been influenced by white supremacist ideas—a theory that appears to be supported by some of his social media posts. The New York Times reported that investigators found a social media profile they believe belonged to Garcia to be \"rife with hate-filled rants against women and Black people.\" Bellingcat's Aric Toler posted on Twitter that Garcia's YouTube channel had a smiley face with Hitler-style mustache as profile image, and shared the screenshot of a picture allegedly portraying the gunman with a swastika and SS tattoos. His social media accounts appear to have since been taken down. While it appears clear that Garcia embraced white supremacist beliefs, it's not clear whether these motivated the shooting—and if they would make his attack qualify as an act of domestic terrorism, something that federal authorities are currently investigating. But Greene has expressed her disbelief that the gunman could be advocating white supremacy as he had a Hispanic name. \"Only dumb white people would believe that a Mexican gang member is killing people for white supremacy,\" she tweeted on Tuesday. The Georgia congresswoman's reaction has been similar to that of right-wing pundits casting doubt over whether a Latino could have been motivated by white supremacy ideology. Conservative author Ann Coulter, whose tweet Greene's responded to, said: \"MEDIA: Texas shooter is Mauricio Garcia, 2d generation immigrant ... and white supremacist. So we could have been spared this horror if only someone had told the shooter: 'Mauricio, you're not white!'\" Right Side Broadcast Brian Glenn, who's reportedly dating Greene, told Steve Bannon on Monday that Garcia couldn't be a white supremacist because he's a Latino and his parents spoke Spanish.

        "text": "Tim Sheehy, a decorated military veteran who Republicans are recruiting to take on Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) in 2024, is a newfound rancher who says he prefers Montana’s “tough” farm country and laments that many of the state’s “scenic valleys have gone the way of luxury resorts and subdivisions.”  But Sheehy is more wealthy businessman than rugged cattleman, with thousands of acres of land and multimillion-dollar properties on Flathead Lake and in the lavish resort community of Big Sky. A Minnesota native, his Montana roots are still relatively young — something that can create headaches when running for public office in Big Sky Country.  Sheehy told HuffPost via email that he and wife Carmen Sheehy, a Marine veteran, “are fortunate to have successful businesses that employ hundreds of Montanans” and “proud to reinvest those earnings back into our community through new business ventures, real estate investments and charitable organizations.”  He declined to comment on the upcoming U.S. Senate race, telling HuffPost that he and his family have not made a decision about whether he will run. But Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who chairs the powerful National Republican Senatorial Committee, is among a growing list of Republicans encouraging him to throw his name in the hat, as Axios reported in March.  “We’ve put a lot on the line for the country,” Tim Sheehy said of he and his wife in a recent interview with Montana Talks radio show. “We’re being asked again to consider serving, and we’re certainly considering it.”  If Sheehy decides to run and is victorious in what is likely to prove a competitive Republican primary, he would square off against Tester, a third-generation Montana farmer who in February announced he will seek a fourth term in the senate. Sheehy has been in touch with former President Donald Trump about his interest in the race, according to Axios.  A former Army Ranger and Navy SEAL, Sheehy deployed multiple times to the Middle East and is a recipient of Purple Heart and Bronze Star. In 2014, upon retiring from the Navy, he moved his family to Montana and founded Bridger Aerospace, a Bozeman-based aerial firefighting company, and its affiliate Ascent Vision Technologies, which developed surveillance and imaging systems for the defense and aerospace industries. CACI International acquired AVT in 2020 for $350 million.  That same year, Sheehy waded into the ranching business — a move that could play well in a future run against Tester, the only working farmer in the Senate and considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in Congress.  In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sheehys purchased three contiguous ranches in Martinsdale, Montana and, with the help of Tim’s friend and fellow former Navy SEAL Greg Putnam, started the Little Belt Cattle Company. Today, the company actively ranches approximately 30,000 private and leased acres and owns 2,000 cattle, Sheehy said, with a focus on regenerative ranching practices.  “Our mission is to have the ability to feed, process and deliver sustainably raised USDA certified beef right here in Montana,” Sheehy said, referring to the Department of Agriculture. “I am proud to be supporting the Montana AG [agriculture] community by forging alternate paths to market for our ranchers and their products.”  In 2020, Sheehy partnered with Montana Land Reliance, a nonprofit land trust, to protect his privately owned ranch lands, over 6,000 acres, under a single conservation easement. He said that while his day job is aerial firefighting, he is involved in day-to-day ranching activities with his wife and four children.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nTim Sheehy is a decorated military veteran and wealthy businessman who Republicans are recruiting to run against Sen.

Former President Donald Trump at a campaign event in Grimes, Iowa, on June 1, 2023. Scott Olson/Getty Images  Donald Trump spent some of Thursday complaining about calling things \"woke.\"  His objection — based on the idea that the term is poorly understood — did not last long.  Later on Thursday he was back to using it liberally to trash the US military.  Former President Donald Trump used the term \"woke\" to mock the US military only hours after saying he thought that line of attack was ineffective because people don't know what it means.  \"They're not learning to fight and protect us from some very bad people, they want to go woke, they want to go woke — that's all they talk about now,\" said Trump at a town hall event hosted Thursday by Fox News.  It directly contradicted what he said earlier that day at a campaign event in Iowa.  He said: \"I don't like the term 'woke' because I hear 'woke, woke, woke' — you know, it's like just a term they use, half the people can't even define it, they don't know what it is.\"  As Insider's Kelsey Vlamis reported, Trump's decision to attack the term appeared to be a jab at his rival Ron DeSantis, who has made countering perceived wokeness a central part of his political identity.  Trump's stated distaste for the word is also contradicted by years of his previous actions, right up to the present.  As recently as Saturday, Trump complained on his Truth Social network that Disney was \"Woke and Disgusting,\" an attack in much the same vein as DeSantis in his high-profile feud with the company.  Railing against wokeness has long been commonplace for Trump. Some things he has called woke:  Meanwhile on Thursday, DeSantis' campaign was distracted by his inconsistent pronunciation of his surname.  After news outlets and Trump picked up on his tendency to flit between the variants Deh-Santis and Dee-Santis, a reporter asked him straight up which was right. DeSantis' response was that his surname is pronounced \"winner.\"<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFormer President Donald Trump used the term \"woke\" to mock the US military only hours after saying he thought that line of attack was ineffective because people don't know what it means.\nTrump's stated distaste for the word is contradicted by years of his previous actions, including his recent attack on Disney for being \"woke and disgusting.\"\nMeanwhile, Trump's rival Ron DeSantis has made countering perceived wokeness a central part of his political identity, and was recently distracted by his inconsistent pronunciation of his surname.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nDonald Trump used the term \"woke\" to mock the US military only hours after saying he thought that line of attack was ineffective because people don't know what it means.\nTrump has long been railing against wokeness, calling Disney \"Woke and Disgusting\" as recently as Saturday.\nTrump's rival Ron DeSantis has made countering perceived wokeness a central part of his political identity.\nDeSantis' campaign was distracted by his inconsistent pronunciation of his surname, which he said was pronounced \"winner.\""

        "text": "© NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University null  A NASA lunar orbiter has spotted the final resting place of a private Japanese moon lander that failed in its touchdown attempt last month.  The Hakuto-R lander, also carrying a small rover for the United Arab Emirates, made its landing attempt on April 25, aiming to set down in Atlas Crater. However, communications with the lander were lost moments before the expected landing. The ispace team behind the lander later confirmed that the lander did not safely touch down on the surface.  Now the site of the apparent crash has been discovered in images taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).  Related: Private Japanese lander sets distance record on its way to the moon  On April 26, LRO acquired 10 images around the landing site with its Narrow Angle Cameras (NACs), and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) science team set about searching for the lost lander.  Images published by the LROC team on Tuesday (May 23) show at least four prominent pieces of debris and several small changes on the lunar surface at 47.581 degrees north latitude and 44.094 degrees east longitude, according to a team statement.  \"The central feature in the image above shows several bright pixels in the upper left and several dark pixels in the lower right. This is the opposite of nearby boulders, suggesting this could be a small crater or different parts of the lander body,\" the statement reads.  \"This site will be analyzed more over the coming months as LROC has the opportunity to reimage the site under various lighting and viewing geometries.\"  LRO has also imaged the sites of earlier failed landing attempts, including the 2019 try by the Israeli Beresheet spacecraft.

        "text": "House GOP leadership has urged quick passage of the bill, describing it as a historic agreement that would reduce spending and get the nation’s fiscal house back on track. But conservatives are livid, saying it falls short of the spending reductions needed to sufficiently reduce the deficit.  The Fiscal Responsibility Act would raise the debt limit until 2025, hold spending flat in 2023, and limit spending to a 1% increase in 2024, with the promise of future reductions in the coming years. It also includes priorities Republicans sought like new work requirements for federal safety net programs and smaller funding for the Internal Revenue Service.  Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) added: “We will do everything in our power to stop it and end it now.”  “No matter what happens, there’s going to be a reckoning about what just occurred,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said Tuesday at a press conference with 10 other Freedom Caucus members who viewed to oppose the agreement.  © Provided by HuffPost Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) attends a news conference with senators and members of the House Freedom Caucus on the debt limit and spending reforms, in the Senate studio of the U.S. Capitol on March 22.  “Kevin McCarthy has done a good job of speaking the language. His No. 1 slogan is national debt is the greatest threat we have to America — that’s out of his words,” Rep Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said Tuesday. “It’s time to go back to the drawing table. It’s time for us to say no.”  Earlier in the day, Roy called the deal a “betrayal” and appeared to threaten McCarthy’s position as speaker if the legislation advances toward a vote on the House floor.  “We’re going to have to then regroup and figure out the whole leadership arrangement again,” Roy said during an interview with conservative radio host Glenn Beck.  Under new rules agreed to by McCarthy when he became speaker, only one member of Congress is needed to force a vote on removing the speaker. The motion would need a simple majority of the House to pass.  It’s unclear whether Roy is serious about moving to oust McCarthy or whether his comments are simply bluster. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), another Freedom Caucus member, dismissed the possibility of such a maneuver, suggesting it lacked the support among House GOP.  “It would fail,” Gaetz tweeted on Tuesday.  Opposition from hard-line conservatives to the deal isn’t unexpected. It was always likely they wouldn’t support a compromise, and that more moderate Republicans, alongside with their Democratic counterparts, will be needed to get the bill through the House.  But rising hostility on the right could fuel a serious threat to McCarthy’s speakership — in the present, or in the months to come.

A fourth file was a 23 gigabyte binary file containing ones and zeroes, allegedly containing packet capture data, or 'PCAPs.'\"  Lindell had repeatedly claimed that his data showed packet captures of votes being switched from Trump to Joe Biden, but Zeidman said he couldn't find that format at all, and three remaining files he'd downloaded didn't show anything meaningful.  \"I started with the ominously named file Chinese_SourceIP_HEX.txt,\" Zeidman wrote. \"Having programmed computers for about 50 years, I recognized that each of these hex numbers seemed to represent a code for alphanumeric characters known as ASCII code. So I took a software tool I’d written years ago and ran this text file through it to turn the text representation of numbers into actual numbers.\"  He ran the data through various tools and found none of it made sense or held any meaning.  \"With no other information, they were about as meaningful as a list of random words,\" Zeidman wrote. \"At that point, it was obvious that the data in these text files were not anything related to the 2020 election. That’s when I knew I had stumbled onto the key. Not the key to showing election fraud, but the key to showing Lindell’s nonsense.\"  \"I repeated the same process on the other text files and found even stranger stuff,\" he added. \"These files were also obfuscated word processor documents, but contained thousands of lines of gibberish — nothing more than random characters and numbers.\"  Zeidman swiftly left the contest at that point and wrote up a report that he registered online with the U.S. Copyright Office to prove it came before Lindell's deadline, and he told his wife to start thinking about what she wanted to do with the pillow monger's promised $5 million prize for anyone who could disprove his claims -- which a judge has ordered him to pay but he's currently fighting in court.  \"Lately, people have been saying to me that I 'saved democracy in America,'\" Zeidman said. \"I’m really flattered, though I think that’s an exaggeration.

        "text": "Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas has abandoned his own stated principles and changed his position on one of America’s most significant regulatory doctrines. Why? A dark money network of conservative billionaires is making his family rich.  © Provided by Jacobin Justice Clarence Thomas at the Supreme Court building, Washington DC, September 29, 2009. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images)  Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas changed his position on one of America’s most significant regulatory doctrines after his wife reportedly accepted secret payments from a shadowy conservative network pushing for the change. Thomas’s shift also came while he was receiving lavish gifts from a billionaire linked to other groups criticizing the same doctrine — which is now headed back to the high court.  The so-called “Chevron deference” doctrine stipulates that the executive branch — not the federal courts — has the power to interpret laws passed by Congress in certain circumstances. Conservatives for years have fought to overturn the doctrine, a move that would empower legal challenges to federal agency regulations on everything from climate policy to workplace safety to overtime pay.  Thomas wrote a landmark Supreme Court opinion upholding the doctrine in 2005, but began questioning it a decade later, before eventually renouncing his past opinion in 2020 and claiming that the doctrine itself might be unconstitutional. Now, Thomas could help overturn the doctrine in a new case the high court just agreed to hear next term.  Groups within the conservative legal movement funded by Leonard Leo’s dark money network and affiliated with Thomas’s billionaire benefactor Harlan Crow have organized a concerted effort in recent years to overturn Chevron. That campaign unfolded as they delivered gifts and cash to Thomas and his family in the lead-up to his shift on the doctrine.  In 2010, Crow bankrolled a dark money group led by Thomas’s wife, Virginia or “Ginni,” that paid her $120,000. Leo was on the group’s board of directors. In 2012, Leo’s dark money network steered undisclosed consulting payments to Thomas’s wife. The Leo network has funded Republican politicians and several nonprofits pressing the Supreme Court to overturn the Chevron doctrine next term.  Crow, meanwhile, provided luxury travel to the Thomas family for two decades. The justice did not report those trips, and similarly failed to disclose that Crow bought his mother’s house, and allowed her to keep living there rent free, and paid his grandnephew’s boarding school tuition.  Groups within the conservative legal movement funded by Leonard Leo’s dark money network have organized a concerted effort in recent years to overturn Chevron.  Last year, Crow’s wife joined the board of trustees at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that pressed the Supreme Court to hear the new case aimed at ending the Chevron doctrine.  Crow also cofounded the Club For Growth, a pro-business dark money group that issued a memo pining for the end of the Chevron doctrine.  Spokespeople for Leo, Crow’s company, and the Supreme Court did not respond to the Lever’s requests for comment.  Thomas Reverses Himself  After revelations of the gifts and cash, Thomas’s most loyal defenders have sought to deflect criticism by depicting the justice as immune from influence, insisting that he “refuses to compromise his principles,” as Utah senator and former Supreme Court clerk Mike Lee (R) claimed in a tweet on Monday.  But in this situation, Thomas abandoned his own stated principles on an issue at the heart of one of the conservative movement’s most significant crusades to limit government regulation.  At issue is the 1984 Supreme Court case Chevron USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council, brought by environmental advocates to challenge the Ronald Reagan administration’s weakening of air pollution regulations.  The Supreme Court deferred to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) interpretation of the Clean Air Act, over the protests of environmentalists. The ruling was initially seen as a win for polluters, but it created the so-called Chevron doctrine, which became a landmark principle in administrative law, empowering federal agencies to interpret and implement statutes.  Justice Thomas was initially a defender of the Chevron doctrine. In 2005, he penned a decision upholding it — over the dissent of his fellow conservative justice Antonin Scalia.  The case, National Cable & Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services, addressed a federal agency’s ability to regulate cable companies under a 1934 law.  Thomas wrote the majority opinion, arguing that the lower court should have applied the Chevron doctrine to the case and deferring to the agency’s interpretation of the law.  “If a statute is ambiguous, and if the implementing agency’s construction is reasonable, Chevron requires a federal court to accept the agency’s construction of the statute, even if the agency’s reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation,” Thomas wrote, defending both the legitimacy of the doctrine and its application in a landmark administrative law case.  But within the ensuing decade, Thomas changed course to crusade against Chevron deference, eventually arguing that his own opinion in the 2005 case had been ill-advised.  “In a period spanning less than three months in the spring of 2015, Justice Thomas issued five concurring or dissenting opinions that set forth a comprehensive, originalist take on the administrative state,” one of his former clerks, Elbert Lin, wrote in a Yale Law Journal article in 2017. “Though Justice Thomas himself had authored one of the Court’s most significant cases affording deference to administrative agencies — National Cable & Telecommunications Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Services — I argue it should come as little surprise that he would be the first to question that case if he felt the Constitution demanded it.”  Thomas changed course to crusade against Chevron deference, eventually arguing that his own opinion in the 2005 case had been ill-advised.  One of those five opinions came in Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency, a 2015 case challenging the EPA’s ability to regulate power plants under the Clean Air Act. Thomas joined the conservative majority, ruling that the EPA had overstepped its authority, and wrote his own concurrence arguing that Chevron deference unconstitutionally delegated power from the judiciary to the executive branch.  “Although we hold today that EPA exceeded even the extremely permissive limits on agency power set by our precedents, we should be alarmed that it felt sufficiently emboldened by those precedents to make the bid for [Chevron] deference that it did here,” Thomas wrote.  In 2020, he went even further, making the unusual move of renouncing his own decision in the 2005 Brand X case.  That year, conservative groups were petitioning the Supreme Court to take an administrative law case involving Howard and Karen Baldwin, two movie producers who had overpaid taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and were trying to get their money back using an obscure argument about the postmark date of a letter.  The Baldwins lost their case at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which cited Brand X precedent in ruling against the couple. The Leo-linked New Civil Liberties Alliance petitioned the Supreme Court to hear an appeal and overturn Brand X. Leo’s dark money group donated $1 million in 2020 to the New Civil Liberties Alliance.  The Supreme Court voted not to take the case, with only Thomas dissenting.  “Although I authored Brand X, it is never too late to ‘surrende[r] former views to a better considered position,’” Thomas wrote, quoting from a 1950 court decision. “Brand X appears to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and traditional tools of statutory interpretation. My skepticism of Brand X begins at its foundation — Chevron deference . . . Chevron is in serious tension with the Constitution, the [Administrative Procedures Act], and over 100 years of judicial decisions.”  Flipping the Court  Thomas’s stunning reversal did not happen in a vacuum — it happened amid a coordinated campaign by the conservative movement, led by a network that enriched him.  In the early 2010s, conservative groups began to take aim at the Chevron doctrine, building a case against it through law review articles, legal challenges to regulations, and by installing justices on the court who were willing to overturn it.  “Conservative jurists, commentators, began to see Chevron as empowering the administrative state in ways they didn’t like,” Thomas Merrill, a professor at Columbia Law School, told Bloomberg.  The Federalist Society, the conservative lawyers organization where Leo is cochair, was at the center of these efforts, publishing articles and touting theories undermining the Chevron doctrine and the administrative state. The American Enterprise Institute (AEI), where Crow sits on the board of trustees, was also agitating against the Chevron doctrine.  “The constant but erratic appeal to Chevron deference seems to us unsound not only for the exalted position that it confers on administrative expertise, but also for the massive political forces — think again of Sprietsma — that it unleashes at the highest levels inside the executive branch and administrative agencies,” read a 2011 publication by AEI.  A 2014 AEI publication lamented, “Chevron has become little more than a sedative for courts clearly anguished by the imaginative excesses of agencies, but unsure of the proper role of the judiciary in reining in those excesses.”  While conservative activists launched a judicial offensive funded by Leo’s dark money network, Leo and Crow were also moving behind the scenes to influence the justices with gifts and payments.  The Washington Post reported last week that Leo steered payments to Thomas’s wife, Ginni, through a polling company run by Donald Trump pollster Kellyanne Conway, and the expenses were quickly covered by Leo’s dark money network.  “No mention of Ginni, of course,” Leo wrote as he instructed Conway to give Ginni Thomas “another $25K.”  Leo, Ginni Thomas, and Crow were all involved with Liberty Central, a Tea Party–themed dark money group formed in 2010. The organization was initially funded with $500,000 from Crow, according to Politico, while Leo served on its board of directors. The organization paid $120,000 to Ginni Thomas.  Over the past two decades, Crow has frequently provided the Thomas family with private jet and superyacht trips that Clarence Thomas failed to disclose. Crow also bought a house owned by Thomas, and allowed his mother to live there rent-free, and paid at least two years of boarding school tuition for Thomas’ grandnephew whom the justice said he raised “as a son.”  Thomas’s fellow conservative on the court, Scalia, had also flipped from being one of Chevron’s staunchest defenders to suggesting it be overturned.  The largesse that flowed to Thomas was part of a larger movement to pack the court with the kinds of justices who would throw out long-standing precedents like Chevron.  As President Trump’s judicial adviser, Leo helped select three of the court’s six conservative justices — while his dark money network simultaneously spent tens of millions to boost their confirmation campaigns.  At least two of those justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, were on record publicly opposing the Chevron doctrine.  When Gorsuch was nominated to replace Scalia in 2017, his hostility to Chevron deference was a key issue in congressional questioning. As a lower court judge, Gorsuch had penned an infamous opinion calling Chevron “a judge-made doctrine for the abdication of the judicial duty.” Gorsuch would not only be to the right of Scalia on Chevron, but also could push the court’s existing conservatives to overturn the doctrine.  While conservative activists launched a judicial offensive funded by Leo’s dark money network, Leo and Crow were also moving behind the scenes to influence the justices with gifts and payments.  “Gorsuch may be the one to bring the court together on fundamental questions of administrative power that have sparked so much controversy and divisiveness in recent years,” corporate lawyer and conservative commentator Andrew Grossman told Reuters.  The next Trump appointee, Kavanaugh, also opposed Chevron. Leo told the New York Times that reining in executive branch agencies was becoming a key priority for the conservative court: “It’s the next step in the national debate about the proper role of the courts. The administrative state is 75 years old,” he said, referring to the Administrative Procedures Act. “It’s become a huge, glaring issue.”  Trump’s third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, had not indicated a clear position on Chevron in previous cases, and declined to reveal her position on Chevron during her confirmation hearing. “As a sitting judge and as a judicial nominee, it would not be appropriate for me to offer an opinion on abstract legal issues or hypotheticals relating to that precedent,” she said.  Club for Growth, the nonprofit cofounded by Crow, published a memo on the issue of Barrett’s position on “Chevron & Administrative Deference,” which noted: “If Judge Amy Coney Barrett were seated on the Supreme Court, her judicial philosophy would have a positive impact on limiting agency overregulation.”  Club for Growth spent $5 million boosting Barrett’s confirmation.  Leo’s Network Lobbies to Kill Chevron  Thomas’s reversal on the Chevron doctrine — and the conservative movement’s success in stacking the court — is more relevant than ever: last week, justices voted to hear a case that could kill the doctrine outright.  The case, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, deals with a Commerce Department rule that stipulates how fishery inspectors are paid. But the substantive issue in the case is whether the Supreme Court should overturn Chevron — as a slew of Leo-backed groups is lobbying the court to do.  The New Civil Liberties Alliance, which received $1 million in 2020 from Leo’s network, filed a brief supporting Loper Bright Enterprises. Leo’s group additionally contributed $350,000 in 2020 and again in 2021 to the Independent Women’s Forum. That organization’s affiliate, the Independent Women’s Law Center, filed its own supportive brief in the case.  Leo’s network donated $1 million between 2020 and 2021 to Advancing American Freedom, a nonprofit led by former vice president Mike Pence that submitted a brief in Loper Bright Enterprises.  The Leo network has been the longtime top financier of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which elects GOP attorneys general. In December, eighteen Republican attorneys general filed a brief in Loper Bright Enterprises supporting the petitioners.  The Manhattan Institute, where Crow’s wife is on the board, also filed an amicus brief asking the court to hear the case designed to overturn Chevron.

The whistleblower, who came forward to Rep. James Comer, R-Ky. and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, alleged the FBI and Justice Department hold a \"1023 form\" that lays out a criminal engagement between then-Vice President Biden and a foreign national involving a money-for-policy-decisions swap.  When former Intel Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., heard Wray was offering a viewing of the alleged document rather than a full copy, he urged Comer to not let up on his contempt-of-Congress threat unless the bureau fully cooperates.  Nunes said the FBI acted in a similar fashion toward him and other Republicans when he was in Congress, telling \"The Story\" the bureau's modus operandi was to repeat for weeks there is \"nothing to see here\" – and then suddenly ask either himself or then-Rep.

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Michelle Obama No, Michelle Obama is not running for president: The former First Lady has been adamant for many years that she has no interest at all in running for president herself. A new Wall Street Journal editorial suggests that she could step in for Joe Biden if he doesn’t run. Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad Michelle Obama Running? Not So Fast... Throughout her time as First Lady, Michelle Obama emerged as quite a popular figure among Democratic voters. Her approval rating, for most of the past 15 years, has been higher than that of her husband. While Michelle has often appeared on the campaign trail, and regularly speaks at each Democratic National Convention, the former First Lady has been adamant, all along, that she has no interest in running for political office herself. She stated this most recently in an interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year. Nevertheless, speculation about a Michelle Obama presidential run has persisted, from a few different directions. Sometimes it’s Democrats unhappy with the current crop of candidates at the time who think the former First Lady would be better, or conservatives either seeking to fearmonger — as the National Republican Senatorial Committee did in 2022, with a fundraising mailer based on the idea of Michelle running — or who see an Obama restoration as the culmination of many years of the Obamas pulling the strings behind the scenes. The latter is a sequel to previous fear-mongering about the Clintons, with the difference being that Hillary Clinton did seek the presidency. Where Did the Rumor Start? Some recent floatings of the Michelle-for-President rumor have come from another place: Mindless horse race politics. An op-ed in The Hill last year described Michelle as the Democrats’ “break glass in case of emergency” candidate, pointing at her popularity and “winner’s aura.” The latest version of this came on Sunday, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed by pollsters Douglas Schoen and Andrew Stein. The headline: “If Biden Bows Out, How About Michelle Obama?” Citing the recent ABC News/Washington Post poll that showed Biden six points behind Donald Trump — one that, compared to other recent polls, may very well be an outlier — Schoen and Stein went straight to speculating about the possibility of the Democrats replacing Biden as their standard bearer. “We aren’t the only Democrats considering alternatives and wondering: If not Mr. Biden, who should be the nominee?” Schoen wrote. The op-ed goes through several potential replacement candidates, including Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom, only to find them all wanting. The name of Hillary Clinton — whom Schoen once worked for — was invoked as well, although the authors ultimately cite a Zogby Analytics poll from last year showing that the most popular non-Biden 2024 candidate among Democrats would be… Michelle Obama. “Mrs. Obama is popular within the Democratic Party. She left the White House with a 68% favorability rating nationally and was one of the most admired women in the U.S. from 2018 through 2020, according to Gallup polls. With a broad network of supporters and the ability to resurrect,” Schoen and Stein write. “Barack Obama’s political organization, she would be the strongest candidate by far.” As for the customary paragraph hand-waving away the former First Lady’s 15-year unbroken streak of stating that she has no interest in seeing public office, the authors say that “while Mrs. Obama has expressed no desire to seek national office, she may be persuaded to jump in if Mr. Biden can’t run and Mr. Trump appears close to returning to the White House.” Schoen and Stein refer to themselves as Democrats and use the term “we” to describe the party, but as Politico pointed out back in 2011, Schoen has frequently done a maneuver in which he describes himself as a Democrat but either bashes the party or gives them advice that entails the party capitulating to whatever Republicans want at the time. Schoen also appeared on Fox News frequently for many years, although he joined Newsmax in 2021. Expertise and Experience: Stephen Silver is a Senior Editor for 19FortyFive.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  During the 2008 presidential campaign, former President Clinton made a fateful prediction. Hillary, he said, would face her biggest challenge in the primaries and not in the general election.  For Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), the reverse probably will be true; the general election will be the more difficult of the two. That’s because he’ll be running against just one president in the primaries; he’ll likely face two in the general election if he even makes it that far.  Former President Trump hasn’t said “pick me or I’ll bolt” since he launched his 2024 campaign — not in so many words, anyway. He’s implied as much, however, more than once, including last December when he subtly teased a third-party run on his Truth Social website.  By the middle of next summer, Trump may have stopped teasing his supporters and taken the plunge. If so, the outcome of the 2024 election will be a foregone conclusion.  If Trump doesn’t get picked, he’ll almost certainly go rogue. And in a three-way race with the former president, DeSantis will be crushed. So why did the governor decide to run?  Three possible reasons come to mind. The first involves the name recognition needed to become president.  DeSantis is well-known in Florida but not outside of the state. Despite the threat of a split vote, he may be running for the national exposure he’ll get as a presidential contender.  The 2024 primaries will be an uphill fight for DeSantis, but he could lose and still gain from the experience. In the debates and on the trail, he’ll tell the American people who he is and what he stands for. If he’s a good salesman, millions will flock to his campaign, and he’ll have a base he can build on in four years — something he could never have had if he had deferred. This explanation works, even if DeSantis believes Trump will win going away.  The second theory for why DeSantis is running involves what Trump has actually done — or rather, not done yet. He has not said explicitly that he’ll bolt if he isn’t picked. As mentioned, he’s only implied he’ll do so.  Trump knows the move would help Democrats win in 2024. So why would he bolt? Rather than go rogue, he could put his party first, gracefully bow out if he’s not picked and go quietly into the night.  If DeSantis believes this with happen, though, he’s guilty of wishful thinking. Trump has never put his party first, and he surely wouldn’t start doing so after losing the nomination. Instead, he’ll just be Trump. He’ll claim he got robbed, trash the DeSantis delegates for dissing him and then run as an independent in order to punish the governor for “stealing” the nomination.  Consider one last reason DeSantis doesn’t seem as worried about the possibility of a split vote as might be expected. Maybe he thinks that if Trump isn’t picked, he will bolt, but he won’t get enough support to impact the outcome of the election.  The problem with this theory should be obvious as well. Trump got 74 million votes in 2020, the second-most ever in a U.S. election. According to the polls, he still has rock solid support among 25-30 percent of Republicans. As a third-party candidate, he’ll get at least as many votes as Ross Perot got in 1992 (19.7 million), and DeSantis will be doomed. In fact, Trump could bow out after not getting picked, and DeSantis still wouldn’t have a prayer against Biden; nor would any other Republican.  Prices are falling, and with the Fed’s 10 rate hikes and the Inflation Reduction Act lowering energy costs, the trend should continue through next year. If so, Biden will easily win reelection based on a strong economy, no matter who he faces in the fall of 2024.  So, the question bears repeating: Why did DeSantis decide to run? In fact, he probably should have deferred. He won’t gain anything by running unless the first theory is correct, and the exposure he gets helps him win the White House in 2028.

Gavin Newsom (D) on Tuesday slammed Target’s chief executive for pulling LGBTQ and Pride Month merchandise from store shelves after facing backlash and threats of violence from some customers.  “CEO of Target Brian Cornell selling out the LGBTQ+ community to extremists is a real profile in courage. This isn’t just a couple stores in the South. There is a systematic attack on the gay community happening across the country,” Newsom wrote in a tweet Tuesday night.  “Wake up America. This doesn’t stop here. You’re black? You’re Asian? You’re Jewish? You’re a woman? You’re next,” the California governor continued.  On Tuesday, Target announced it was making “adjustments to our plans” to promote and sell Pride Month merchandise, which has been on sale since the beginning of May, ahead of Pride Month, which is June. Target attributed the decision to “volatile circumstances” that were impacting staff’s “sense of safety and well-being while at work.”  Target did not say which items would be removed from shelves but confirmed it moved its Pride merchandise to the back of some stores in the South.  “Since introducing this year’s collection, we’ve experienced threats impacting our team members’ sense of safety and well-being while at work,” Target’s statement read. ”Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior.”  According to the most recent FBI data, hate crimes reported against people targeted for their sexual orientation increased by 54 percent from 2020 to 2021.

        "text": "© Provided by Salon Marjorie Taylor GreeneKevin Dietsch/Getty Images  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a very tedious person. Even writing her name drains one's energy; she's like a fascist black hole.  So what is the best way to respond to someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene? Should we ignore her, and those of her ilk, and hope that she will magically disappear? Are those of us with a public platform elevating Marjorie Taylor Greene by giving her too much attention and therefore giving her more power and influence than she merits?  The answer is no.  Marjorie Taylor Greeene is a very dangerous person, a leading member of the Republican Party and larger neofascist movement. Proving that to be true once again, last week Marjorie Taylor Greene summoned up the country's unique history of white on Black spectacular lynchings and other white supremacist violence in an attempt to gain political leverage, attention and more power.  On Wednesday, Greene and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., were involved in what was by all reasonable accounts an animated and somewhat heated, albeit playful, conversation on the steps of the Capitol after a procedural vote on expelling indicted felon Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., from office.  On Thursday, Marjorie Taylor Greene held a press conference where she told bald-faced lies about Bowman's behavior and her interactions with him the previous day and in the past, as Salon's Tatyana Tandanpolie summarized:  Greene at a Thursday news conference said that she is \"very concerned\" about the \"history of aggression\" she claimed Bowman has toward her and other members of Congress. She described her perspective of the altercation, saying that Bowman approached her \"yelling, shouting, raising his voice,\" which led to the argument. \"He has aggressive — his physical mannerisms are aggressive,\" she said, adding, \"I think there's a lot of concern about Jamaal Bowman, and I am concerned about it. I feel threatened by him.\" Greene claimed on Thursday that Bowman accosted her with a \"mob\" when she traveled to New York to protest Trump's indictment on felony charges of falsifying business records. She said that Bowman cursed at her, \"shouted at the top of his lungs\" and called her a \"white supremacist,\" a remark that deeply offended her…. Greene added that she felt \"swarmed\" and feared for her life.  Greene's statements are not true. Her life was not threatened or in any way endangered by Rep. Bowman either on Wednesday or during her publicity stunt in New York in support of the traitor and now indicted and arrested former president and alleged felon Donald Trump.  If Greene felt \"threatened\" by Bowman that is a manifestation of her own white racist paranoiac thinking for which she should seek counseling or other mental health assistance. Bowman was not physically aggressive towards Greene on Wednesday or on other occasions. Bowman has not been the subject of any reasonably reported concerns or complaints by other members of Congress about his \"history of aggression.\"  Marjorie Taylor Greene is some type of idiot savant in white supremacy and racism.  In total, Marjorie Taylor Greene's threatening lies about Rep. Bowman are an example of some of the worst aspects of America's long history of white supremacist violence against Black men (and Black and brown people more generally) – and white women's role in instigating (and profiting from) it. Greene's comments about Bowman were literally as though she was reciting a script from post-civil war Jim and Jane Crow America, with the almost identical words and lies that caused thousands of Black men (and women and children) to be lynched and otherwise terrorized by white people.  Moreover, it would not have been at all surprising if Greene did not summon up some tears on Wednesday outside of the Capitol or during her press conference the next day as she started to howl about how Bowman was a \"giant negro\" and \"predator\" who desired her and had violated her \"honor.\" White women's tears were and remain some of the most powerful white supremacist weapons of terror and violence against Black and brown people.  If the movies \"Birth of a Nation\" or \"Rosewood\" were ever remade, Greene should be cast as one of the main characters. On the call sheet and in the credits her character should be listed as \"white woman who lies and gets Black man lynched.\"  Related Marjorie Taylor Greene shows off her Confederate beer cooler in a new workout video  White supremacy and racism are learned behaviors and a type of cultural script that consists of stories, \"common sense\", emotional training, and other tools for making sense of the world. No one may have sat down with Marjorie Taylor Greene when she was a child or young adult and explicitly told her that \"these are words and performance that you as a white woman can use to get a Black person arrested or hurt or worse\" (and/or also get yourself out of trouble and get attention and pity by making yourself into a fake victim) but she learned the lessons anyway. The many ways that these lessons are taught and learned, intentionally and intentionally, consciously and subconsciously, on both sides of the color line, is why experts describe America as being a racist culture.  And in an example of the increasingly surreal and absurd ways that white supremacy operates in post-civil rights \"colorblind\" America and the Age of Trump — an era where even the Ku Klux Klan claims that it is no longer a racist organization — Marjorie Taylor Greene went so far as to say the following during her press conference on Thursday:  Jamaal Bowman [was] shouting at the top of his lungs, cursing, calling me a horrible … calling me a white supremacist which I take great offense to that…. It's like calling a person of color the N-word which should never happen. Calling me a white supremacist is equal to that. That is wrong.  Marjorie Taylor Greene's words constitute a nonsense claim and a nonsensical riddle that only make sense as processed through white racial logic and how white supremacy distorts a person's cognition, perception of reality, morality and ethics. The \"n-word\" was invented by white people as a way of dehumanizing and demeaning Black people in order to justify slavery, land theft, genocide, colonialism, imperialism, theft, murder, rape, and other acts of oppression and crimes against humanity.  Marjorie Taylor Greene has repeatedly shown herself through her actions and words to be a white supremacist.  To accurately describe a person as being a white supremacist (or being part of a political project that does the work of white supremacy, which is functionally the same thing) is in no way equivalent to attacking a Black person with the \"n-word.\"  Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.  As seen with the rise of the Age of Trump and the Republican Fascist Party, many tens of millions of white people agree with Marjorie Taylor Greene and her fantasies, fictions, and lies about \"reverse racism\" and how white people are somehow the \"real victims\" of racism in American or that white people are somehow being \"replaced\" or \"oppressed\" in \"their own countries\" by non-whites.  Parsing such white racial \"logic\" is draining. Toni Morrison's wisdom remains all too true that, \"The function, the very serious function of racism is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being….\" It is no surprise then that racial battle fatigue is literally killing Black and brown people here in America from the day-to-day stress of living in a white racist society.  In his essential book, \"Trouble in Mind Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow\", historian Leon Litwack offers the following insights, which merit being quoted at length, on America's lynching culture and white racial terrorism against Black Americans:  White fears were based on the assumption that most lynchings stemmed from sexual assault. But in many cases, reports of sexual assault proved entirely baseless, or upon closer examination revealed only that a black male had broken the rules of racial etiquette, had behaved in a manner construed as racial insult, or had violated the bar on consensual interracial sex…. Rape and sexual indiscretion, in actuality, proved to be a relatively minor cause of mob violence…. The offenses that precipitated mob violence related less to sex crimes (as sensationalized in the press) than to physical assault and murder (the most common charge) theft, arson, violations of the racial code, economic competition, and disputes over crop settlements. Many of the transgressions by blacks would have been regarded as relatively trivial if committed by whites and were not grounds anywhere else for capital punishment: using disrespectful, insulting, slanderous, boastful, threatening or \"incendiary\" language; insubordination, impertinence, impudence or improper demeanor (a sarcastic grin, laughing, laughing at the wrong time, a prolonged silence), refusing to take off one's hat to a white person or to give the right of way (to step aside) when encountering a white on the sidewalk; resisting assault by whites; \"being troublesome generally\"; disorderly conduct, petty theft, or drunkenness; writing an improper (\"insulting\") letter to a white person; paying undue or improper attention to a white female; accusing a white man of writing love letters to a black woman, or living or keeping company with a white woman; turning or refusing to turn state's evidence, testifying or bringing suit against a white person, or being related to a person accused of a crime and already lynched; political activities union organizing, conjuring or discussing a lynching; gambling or operating a \"house of ill fame\"; a personal debt, refusing to accept an employment offer; \"jumping\" a labor contract; vagrancy; refusing to give up one's farm; conspicuously displaying one's wealth or property; and (in the eyes of whites) trying to act like a white man.  Litwack continues:  Victims of lynch mobs, more often than not, had challenged or unintentionally violated the prevailing norms of white supremacy. And these range from serious offenses (in the eyes of whites) to the trivial…. All too often, black southerners, innocent of any crime or offense, were victims of lynchings or burnings because they were black and in the wrong place at the wrong time.... Investigators frequently found no easily ascertainable reason for a lynching, except perhaps white emotional and recreational starvation. For some \"nigger killing\" had simply become a sport, like any other amusement or diversion, and its popularity prompted a Black newspaper in 1911 to call it \"The National Pastime\"…. Although seldom cited as the reason for mob violence, the assumption persisted that an occasional lynching, for whatever reason, served a useful purpose, that periodically it became necessary to remind a new generation of blacks of their place in southern society.  It would strain all credulity to believe that Marjorie Taylor Greene has read Litwack's book (or any other serious works of American history). Yet, she is offering a perfect 21st-century reenactment of his descriptions of America's lynching culture. In that way, perhaps Greene is some type of idiot savant in white supremacy and racism.  History is a moving train.  The America of today is not the same country as it was during Jim and Jane Crow (although the Trumpists and Republican fascists and the larger White Right and MAGAites are desperately trying to recreate it). There has been too much blood spilled, sacrifices made, and progress earned along the color line to suggest that the long Black Freedom Struggle and civil rights movement and its hope warriors of all colors did not win many victories to improve America and its democracy and larger society for all people.  However, America's foundation and its culture are still rotting away from racism and white supremacy and the many forms of social inequality that it nurtures and spreads. In the end, white supremacy, be it in the form of Trumpism or some of other form of neofascism and white racial authoritarianism, will bring the ultimate destruction of American democracy and society.  History is a moving train and at the same time, \"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\"  In that way, it is \"progress\" that after Marjorie Taylor Greene summoned up her racist threats and lies that Rep. Bowman was not chased down and murdered by a white lynching party after they tortured him. It is another type of progress as well, that Rep. Bowman, a Black man, is even a member of Congress. He knows that history and stands on the shoulders of those 16 Black men who served as Representatives during Reconstruction and the hundreds of others who held office in local and state governments across the former Confederacy. A white supremacist backlash ended the great experiment in multiracial democracy that was Reconstruction, and those Black men were forced from office not just in Congress but across the South and other parts of the country.  On Jan. 6, the descendants of the Confederacy and Jim and Jane Crow White America, besieged and overran Congress with the goal of keeping Trump in power indefinitely. The Trump terrorists waved Confederate flags, erected a gallows across the street from the Capitol, carried a White Christian Cross like the Klan, and had many neo-Nazis, Kluxers, and other white supremacist thugs among their mob. The Trump terrorists hurled racial invective at the Black police officers who valiantly defended the Capitol – and American democracy – with their lives. It is no coincidence that Marjorie Taylor Greene supported – and still does – Trump's coup attempt on Jan. 6 and his attempt to end multiracial pluralistic democracy.  Most of the Black people who were victims of America's lynching culture and its Jim and Jane Crow terror regime were denied, literally, the opportunity to speak back to their killers and other assailants. (The white on Black spectacular lynching was a type of ritual; as part of that ritual, one of the common tortures consisted of cutting off the victim's tongue as well as other body parts and selling them as souvenirs). To honor those ancestors, I am ending this essay with Rep. Bowman's own words about his encounter with Marjorie Taylor Greene:<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nRep.

        "text": "© Provided by The Associated Press Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Kelly Craft speaks with supporters during a campaign stop in Liberty, Ky., Wednesday, May 3, 2023. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)  FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — A prominent GOP candidate roiled the hotly contested primary race for Kentucky governor with a comment that if elected, “we will not have transgenders in our school system,\" angering LGBTQ advocates in a state that has enacted laws limiting the rights of transgender youth.  Former U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft made the comment in response to a question during a telephone town hall Monday night. She did not specify what policy actions she envisioned involving transgender students, but her campaign weighed in Tuesday when asked to respond.  “Of course Kelly was referring to the woke ideologies being pushed in our schools,” her campaign said in a statement. “She has been advocating for the best for all children this entire campaign.”  Craft’s comments were swiftly denounced as “desperate and disgusting” by Chris Hartman, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, a Kentucky-based LGBTQ advocacy group.  Craft is waging a combative contest against state Attorney General Daniel Cameron as part of a 12-candidate field vying for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in the May 16 primary. Craft’s running mate, state Sen. Max Wise, sponsored a sweeping law aimed at transgender youth this year.  “Her claim that she and Wise will somehow purge transgender kids from Kentucky schools is nothing more than an unhinged political promise she can’t keep,” Hartman said.  “None of the other candidates are railing this hard against LGBTQ youth because it won’t work, except to harm trans kids,” he added.  The nominee is expected to challenge Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who is seeking reelection to a second term in the GOP-trending state and faces nominal opposition in his party's primary. Other Republican contenders include state Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, state Auditor Mike Harmon, retired attorney Eric Deters and Somerset Mayor Alan Keck.  Craft spent an hour fielding questions reportedly submitted by callers across Kentucky, with topics including her stand on gun rights, abortion and fighting illegal drugs.  One question asked Craft how she’d “combat the transgender agenda” in classrooms. Craft noted that Wise sponsored the measure dealing with, among other things, school bathroom policies, curriculum and which pronouns are used to refer to transgender students.  Craft added: “Under a Craft-Wise administration, we will not have transgenders in our school system.”  She later doubled down in answering the same question, saying: “Under a Craft-Wise administration, we will not have transgender.”  Throughout the campaign, Craft has railed against what she claims are “woke” ideologies infiltrating Kentucky public schools, pledging to lead efforts to overhaul the state education department if elected. With her remarks about transgender children, Craft upped the ante in her culture-war messaging.  The question is whether the strategy will pay off against a field of staunchly conservative candidates. Craft has put millions of her family's fortune into a barrage of TV advertising.  “There’s no doubt that that issue polls very, very well with core Republican primary voters,\" GOP political consultant T.J. Litafik said by phone Tuesday. \"The danger that any candidate faces is going so extreme to win a very small primary vote that you can’t get back to the middle for a general election.”  The Kentucky legislation is part of a widespread movement, along with Republican state lawmakers in other states who have approved extensive measures that restrict the rights of LGBTQ people.  The debate about transgender issues is likely to continue into Kentucky's fall campaign for governor.  Beshear vetoed the sweeping measure that banned gender-affirming medical care for trans youth — one of many provisions affecting young transgender people. Beshear said the legislation amounted to government overreach into parental rights in making medical decisions for their children.  “My faith teaches me that all children are children of God,\" the governor said in his veto message.  The GOP-dominated legislature overrode the veto.  Other parts of the measure require school districts to devise bathroom policies that, “at a minimum,” would not allow transgender children to use the bathroom aligned with their gender identities. It allows teachers to refuse to refer to transgender students by the pronouns they use and requires schools to notify parents when lessons related to human sexuality are going to be taught.  Several Kentucky families with transgender children recently filed a federal lawsuit challenging the sections banning puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender youths. The suit didn’t take aim at other sections dealing with school policies.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nKelly Craft, a prominent GOP candidate in the Kentucky gubernatorial primary race, has caused controversy with her comment that if elected, “we will not have transgenders in our school system.” Her running mate, Max Wise, sponsored a sweeping law aimed at transgender youth this year.\nLGBTQ advocates have denounced her comments as “desperate and disgusting” and her campaign has responded by saying she is advocating for the best for all children.\nThe debate about transgender issues is likely to continue into Kentucky's fall campaign for governor.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nKelly Craft, a prominent GOP candidate for Kentucky governor, has angered LGBTQ advocates with her comment that if elected, “we will not have transgenders in our school system.”\nCraft's running mate, state Sen.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  I am a Gold Star mother, which means I lost a child to war. My son volunteered for the U.S. Army, serving as an intel analyst for the 7th Special Forces Group in the 82nd Airborne. He was deployed twice to Kandahar, Afghanistan, and on Jan. 8, 2016 — after waiting 16 months for treatment from the VA — he died.  The recent fight over the debt ceiling shows me just how little some Republicans care about taking care of the Americans they sent off to war. To rub salt in the wound, Republicans are willing to use veterans like my son as political props to distract from the fact that veterans benefits are being used as a bargaining chip to further a plan that could cripple our national economy.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the only federal agency dedicated to our nation’s 16.5 million veterans. As the families of lost veterans can tell you, VA funding is already woefully inadequate. Yet the GOP members, including my own representative in New York’s 17th District, Mike Lawler, voted for a default plan that could cut funding for the VA by as much as 22 percent.  While House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and the GOP claim they aren’t cutting veterans benefits, they could have easily put that commitment in the bill — just as they did with Social Security. In fact, 24 veteran service organizations sent a letter to House Republicans asking them to protect veterans benefits. Republicans refused.  By not carving out an exception to protect the VA, they’ve put cuts on the negotiating table. Even if Republicans do protect VA funding, their bill threatens housing, job training, and Pell grants for veterans, as well as billions in health care funding for veterans through federal COVID funds.  If that wasn’t enough, this past week a story about homeless veterans in the Hudson Valley being displaced by migrants turned out to be completely false. But New York’s Republican reps, from Mike Lawler to Marc Molinaro to Elise Stefanik, were quick to seize on the story and use our unhoused veterans as political props. Molinaro was shameless enough to send out a fundraising email attacking Democrats for displacing veterans.  The GOP wants us to believe that they’re the party that will stand by our vets. But if McCarthy gets his way in the debt ceiling negotiations, veterans may have to wait months or years to get in to see the appropriate health professional or access housing.  What this means is that his promises of care for veterans like my son, who put their lives on the line to keep us safe, were all just lip service.  If the cuts go through, 80,000 jobs at VA could be lost, resulting in millions fewer available appointments. I wonder if the Speaker has done the math on how many lives will be lost if this is allowed to happen. I wonder how many more mothers will bury their children because of it.  It’s shameful how many Republican members are moving in lockstep with Kevin McCarthy, even when that means hurting veterans and their families. It’s not hard to understand why. They believe that staying on McCarthy’s good side will keep the money flowing in from large donors. They don’t seem to care how their vote could impact veterans in their own districts.  The GOP talks up a good game about its support for the troops, and has no problem using veterans and military imagery to further their extreme agenda. But their default plan is nothing short of an act of betrayal.  Stephanie Keegan is an advocate for veterans after her son passed away in January of 2016 while waiting for treatment from the VA for PTSD and addiction. She is legislative director of Purple Heart Hall of Honor, Inc. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nRepublicans are using veterans benefits as a bargaining chip to further their plans, potentially cutting VA funding by 22%.\nveteran service organizations asked House Republicans to protect veterans benefits, but they refused.\nRepublicans are using veterans as political props and their promises of care for veterans are just lip service.\nThe GOP's default plan is an act of betrayal towards veterans.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThis article is written by Stephanie Keegan, a Gold Star mother who lost her son to war.\nShe criticizes the Republican Party for using veterans as political props and for not protecting veterans benefits in their debt ceiling plan.\nShe argues that the plan could cut funding for the VA by as much as 22 percent and threatens housing, job training, and Pell grants for veterans.\nShe also calls out Republican representatives for using homeless veterans as political props.\nShe believes that the GOP's promises of care for veterans are just lip service."

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI offered Friday to show top lawmakers next week a bureau document that purports to relate to President Joe Biden and his family following weeks of demands by congressional Republicans and a contempt threat against Director Christopher Wray.  In a statement, the FBI said it would produce the document in a secure location inside the U.S. Capitol for the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep.

At issue is an internal FBI document known as an FD-1023, which agents use to record unverified tips and information they receive from confidential human sources. The FBI says such documents can contain uncorroborated and incomplete information, and that documenting the tip does not validate it.  “By offering to provide access to the requested document in combination with a briefing to offer context, the FBI has agreed in good faith to give the Committee all of the information it originally asked for and more,” the FBI said. “The commonsense protections the FBI has requested to maintain the confidentiality of that sensitive information are routinely employed both in response to congressional requests and in court in criminal proceedings to protect the physical safety of sources and the integrity of investigations.”  © Provided by The Associated Press FILE - House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman Rep.

A contempt of Congress charge would require a full committee vote before going to the House floor.  Comer subpoenaed Wray earlier this month seeking a specific FBI form from June 2020.  In a May 3 letter to Wray with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Comer said that “it has come to our attention” that the bureau has such a document that “describes an alleged criminal scheme” involving Biden and a foreign national “relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions” when Biden was vice president and includes “a precise description” about it.  The lawmakers used the word “alleged” three times in the opening paragraph of the letter and offered no evidence of the veracity of the accusations or any details about what they contend are “highly credible unclassified whistleblower disclosures.”  The White House has called the subpoena effort further evidence of how congressional Republicans long “have been lobbing unfounded, unproven, politically motivated attacks” against the Biden family “without offering evidence for their claims or evidence of decisions influenced by anything other than U.S. interests.”  _____  Associated Press writer Farnoush Amiri in Washington contributed to this report.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe FBI has offered to show top lawmakers a document that relates to President Joe Biden and his family next week, following weeks of demands by congressional Republicans and a contempt threat against Director Christopher Wray.\nThe document is an internal FBI document known as an FD-1023, which agents use to record unverified tips and information they receive from confidential human sources.\nThe FBI has requested commonsense protections to maintain the confidentiality of the sensitive information.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Rep.

        "text": "© (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 08: WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 08: U.S. President Joe Biden embraces Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland before announcing the expansion of areas of three national monuments at the White House on October 08, 2021 in Washington, DC. The Biden administration restored the areas of two Utah parks with lands held sacred by several Native American tribes, Bears Ears National Monument and the Grand Staircase-Escalante, as well as the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts of the New England coast, after former President Donald Trump opened them to mining, drilling and development during his time in office. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  Department of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said the quiet part out loud last week. As the executive of our public lands agency, she does not believe that Americans need jobs because there are already so many jobs available. It’s better to lock up land, and lock down mining because who wants those jobs, when there are so many others?  Before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Haaland told Sen. Josh Hawley, “Senator, I know that there’s like 1.9 jobs for every American in the country right now. So, I know there’s a lot of jobs,” which was her explanation for canceling cobalt mining permits for Twin Metals Minnesota, an underground mine proposed for the northeastern part of the state. America won’t need those jobs, she was saying.  Let’s unpack the Haaland job fantasy.  First, the secretary doesn’t get the jobs numbers even close to correct. There are not 1.9 jobs for every American. That would be an absurd level of available jobs, along the order of 629 million open positions.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports there are 9.6 million job openings and roughly 6 million unemployed people in America.  The job openings rate was 5.8 percent in March, down by 1 percentage point since December, according to the bureau.  Sen. Hawley wasn’t buying what Haaland was selling. During the past 20 years, Hawley responded, over 3 million jobs have been lost to China, and they are coming from blue-collar towns across America. “And you’re telling me we have too many jobs in this country. Are you serious?”  Facts, stubborn as they are, are not the secretary’s strong suit.  Second, Haaland revealed herself as a relic of the past, incapable of looking toward the future. She cannot see what is coming around the bend toward our country like a freight train, because she is wedded to a romanticized notion about what America should be, with high plains, headdresses, and hunting for deer and antelope.  Haaland is on a mission to reshape the Department of Interior to the days before Manifest Destiny, with all its good, bad, and ugly, shaped the nation. She is trying to return to what will never be.  With a push from the Biden Administration, Haaland is preparing to adopt new regulations that make conservation the No. 1 priority for the Department of Interior, which owns 246,393,048 acres, with 99.99 percent of that land in the West. There go the jobs.  With Haaland’s narrow view of the world, she cannot see that jobs are on the brink of disappearing across every sector, when, in fact, artificial intelligence is here and has taken the driver’s seat.  This week, for example, IBM’s CEO said it won’t fill nearly 8,000 open jobs because the positions will be shifted over to artificial intelligence in the next five years. Hiring humans for office functions such as human resources and compliance is not a good investment for Big Blue, when those humans will have to be laid off so soon.  That 8,000 represents 2% of the entire IBM workforce, one of the largest employers in the world, who are being replaced by AI. And this phenomenon is just getting started. Those workers will join hundreds of thousands of workers who are being released into the wild in the same general time frame, as AI only gets better at replacing people.  Last week DropBox reported it will lay off 16% of its workforce, switching those jobs over to AI.  Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs reported that AI will soon wipe out as many as 300 million jobs.  Meanwhile, the Minnesota Duluth Complex is one of the world’s largest undeveloped mineral deposits for cobalt, copper, and nickel, all needed in massive quantities for the electric future the Biden Administration is designing.  The project is less than 20% of what an open pit mine would be, and mining operations would be between 400 and 4,500 feet below the surface. It’s in an area set aside for mining.  When Haaland signed the order to deny permits needed, she shifted thousands of more jobs to China, where forced labor will do the work.  Her order says the mining embargo is needed to protect “fragile and vital social and natural resources” as well as the “traditional cultural values” and “subsistence-based lifestyles” of Native American tribes.  These qualities are ill-defined and have shifting goalposts. What is a fragile social resource as it pertains to an underground mine? Which tribes are actually living subsistence lifestyles in northeastern Minnesota?  Here’s what is not poorly defined: Unemployment among American Indians in Minnesota is over 13%, which is 10% higher than the national unemployment rate.  The Haaland traditional lifestyle initiative is to continue the government inducement of intergenerational poverty, reservation ghettoization, and cradle-to-grave dependence on entitlement checks.  That’s not subsistence, that’s not a lifestyle, and there is no dignity in keeping Indians down on the reservation, unable to find work, purchase a home, or enjoy the fruits of their labor.

        "text": "© Cnn/Cnn The CNN Republican Presidential Town Hall with Donald Trump moderated by Kaitlan Collins in New Hampshire.  The morning after the channel’s widely pilloried “town hall” with former president Donald Trump, CNN chairman and CEO Chris Licht defended the program in a call with staffers.  “While we all may have been uncomfortable hearing people clapping, that was also an important part of the story,” Licht said, according to journalist Brian Stelter, adding that Trump’s supporters are “a large swath of America.”  On his own show Thursday night, CNN host Anderson Cooper made a similar argument.  “That man you were so upset to hear from last night, he may be president of the United States in less than two years, and that audience that upset you, that’s a sampling of about half the country,” Cooper said. “… You have every right to be outraged and angry, never watch this network again. But do you think staying in your silo and only listening to people you agree with is going to make that person go away?”  To a large extent, this is a false dichotomy. The choice is not between not understanding Trump’s politics at all and giving him an opportunity to speak live on cable television. To suggest that it is, in fact, is to undermine all of the other excellent reporting on Trump that occurs on CNN and elsewhere. But it’s a useful dichotomy to imply if you’re facing blowback for hosting Trump.  The arguments from Licht and Cooper are also worth considering, too, because they overstate the purported need. Yes, tens of millions of Americans support Trump. But they are neither a quiet, unexamined segment of the population nor half of it.  That first point is easily demonstrated. Every time there’s a presidential election, cable news channels like CNN and its competitors spend some time talking about the candidates’ supporters.  You can see that below: In 2012, as Mitt Romney was challenging President Barack Obama, CNN mentioned his supporters in nearly 1,000 15-second blocks. In 2016, as Hillary Clinton was seeking the presidency, her supporters were mentioned in more than 3,800 blocks of airtime. The pattern on the other major cable-news channels was similar.  You’ll notice that Trump and his supporters aren’t included above. That’s because he breaks the scale.  CNN has collectively mentioned the supporters of Obama, Romney, Clinton and President Biden about 10,000 times since January 2010. It has mentioned Trump’s supporters more than 22,000 times. The pattern is similar on the other cable-news channels: Mentions of Trump supporters far exceed the other candidates, combined. On MSNBC, as on CNN, it’s a 2 to 1 ratio.  Speaking to his team, Licht argued that the failure to understand the strength of support Trump enjoyed was part of the reason that his 2016 victory came as such a surprise. That’s true, to an extent; that Trump’s victory was dependent on the vagaries of the electoral college and not national support certainly plays a role as well.  But that year, as in 2020, support for Trump did not constitute half the country.  Consider how partisan support works. According to the most recent Gallup numbers, about a quarter of the adult population identifies as Republican, the same as with the Democrats. Another fifth or so are independents who say they generally vote with Republicans.  By itself, this offers useful nuance. Independents who lean toward one party generally do so in large part because they oppose the other party. In other words, Republican-leaning independents are often motivated not by agreement with the Republican Party — which they could certainly join if they wanted to — but opposition to the Democrats. Joe Biden’s victory in 2020 was driven by support from independents, many of whom were less enthusiastic about him than they were frustrated at Trump.  That context in mind, we have polling that asks the question fairly directly. In recent YouGov polling conducted for the Economist, about 45 percent of respondents said they viewed Trump strongly or somewhat favorably, getting us near that half-of-Americans mark.  But that “somewhat” is hazy. When Quinnipiac asked the same question in March, without the “somewhat” option, only about a third of respondents said they viewed Trump favorably — more than YouGov’s “strongly favorable” but less than the combined “strongly/somewhat.” It was the same percentage as said they considered themselves supporters of the “Make America Great Again” movement.  Of course, we’re only talking about American adults here, not younger people among whom, it’s safe to assume, Trump is generally even less popular. Even within the universe of adults, however, extrapolating from “didn’t lose by that much in 2020” to “half the country supports him” is a stretch.  First of all, there’s that issue of anti-Biden vs. pro-Trump votes, as above. Second, more adult citizens of the United States didn’t vote at all in 2020 than voted for Trump. If we’re looking only at votes as a measure of support, Trump was supported in 2020 by only about 30 percent of adults who might have been able to vote.  This is not to say that Biden is far more popular; his numbers aren’t much different. But there’s no call for more coverage aimed at understanding Biden and his views — largely because there would be no controversy over airing a similar conversation with Biden.  There’s no question that much of the focus on Trump supporters derives from the reality that media outlets like CNN (and The Washington Post) are centered in large metropolitan areas where right-wing, rural people are definitionally underrepresented. There was surprise, including from within Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, that hostility to “elites” was as deep as Trump’s success indicated.  But that surprise evaporated by early in Trump’s term in office, thanks in part to a flurry of reports on precisely the people that CNN now posits need to be elevated.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  President Joe Biden is 80 years old. That alone should be enough information to conclude that he should refrain from running in 2024. However, if one still wasn’t convinced, then the video of him falling at the U.S. Air Force Academy graduation today surely should hammer home the point.  It is genuinely sad to watch any 80-year-old fall like Biden did today. The video alone, absent political implications, should summon sympathy and prayers that the person is OK. A fall like that could do real harm. However, this all becomes doubly true when it is someone like Biden — who is consistently on the biggest stages in the world and is the single most powerful person in the world. To see the leader of the free world in such a fragile, vulnerable state is a hard pill to swallow.  EVERY HOUSE MEMBER WHO VOTED AGAINST PASSING THE DEBT CEILING BILL  And it is important to recognize that this is not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Biden fell off his bike while in Delaware and approaching the press, and at the start of his presidency, he fell multiple times while going up the stairs of Air Force One. Additionally, while speaking, he has oftentimes sounded legitimately confused and is sometimes just unintelligible.  The problem is likely just going to get worse. If he wins a second term, he will be 82 years old at its start and 86 when it is completed. Comparing Biden’s fitness for office in 2016 versus just four years later in 2020 tells us how much more downhill it could go by 2028 — at the end of his prospective second term.  To fulfill the responsibilities of the president of the United States requires a unique focus, alertness, and ability to handle stress. After all, the commander in chief is tasked with regularly making decisions that change the course of history. But it is clear that Biden is just not up to the job. This is not his fault, of course. Hardly any 80-year-olds would be. But, it is important for him to recognize this, just as most of the country has, and step aside in 2024 for the country’s good and for his own.

        "text": "© Provided by Slate Donald Trump speaks to the press during a Tea Party rally against the Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Donald Trump speaks to the press during a Tea Party rally against the Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  Exactly five years ago, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, in one of the dumbest moves of his presidency—the dumbest when it comes to foreign policy.  This is not a partisan statement. It’s also true that President Joe Biden’s failure to reverse Trump’s misstep ranks as the most puzzling—and may prove to be most catastrophic—decision in his term of office so far.  But Trump’s move on May 8, 2018 set the stage for whatever disasters may come of it. By the time he pulled the plug, Iran was well on its way to dismantling its nuclear program. International inspectors, who were granted full access to suspect sites, said in all of their routine reports that Iran was in full compliance with the deal’s terms.  Now the inspectors are gone, and Iran is closer to building an atom bomb than it ever has been.  Why did Trump abrogate the deal? First, he didn’t much like arms-control agreements of any sort. Second, he particularly distrusted Iran, a view bolstered by his friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (ignoring the fact that most Israeli military and intelligence officers supported the deal). Finally, and perhaps most significant: to Trump’s mind, nothing Obama ever did could be touted as a success, so the Iran deal—a resounding success by all objective measures—had to be pummeled as (in Trump’s oft-repeated words) “the worst deal ever.”  It’s worth recounting here what the Iran nuclear deal—formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—did and did not do. Basically, it required Iran to dismantle almost all of its nuclear program; in exchange, the U.S. would lift almost all of its economic sanctions. In the main clauses, Iran had to:  • Destroy all of its uranium enriched to 3.75 percent and limit further enriched uranium to 3.5 percent. (Weapons-grade uranium is enriched to 90 percent.)  • Cut its uranium stockpile by 90 percent (to 300 kilograms, not enough to build one A-bomb).  • Destroy two-thirds of its centrifuges—the devices that enrich uranium—and refrain from building advanced models, which spin faster.  • Export the spent fuel from its research reactors, which could otherwise be reprocessed into plutonium.  • Stop all work on metallurgy related to the casings for uranium or plutonium bombs.  • Allow officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect all known and suspected nuclear sites with 24 hours’ notice.  The limits on uranium would expire in 10 years (by 2016) but those on centrifuges would last 20 years and IAEA’s monitoring of uranium mines and mills would last 25 years.  In exchange, the U.S. would lift sanctions, which it had imposed when Iran started developing its nuclear program—but it would not lift the sanctions that had been imposed as penalty for producing ballistic missiles or for sponsoring terrorism.  When Trump pulled out, he reimposed all the economic sanctions—not only on Iran but also on any country doing business with Iran. For nearly a year, Iran’s diplomats tried to find ways around the restrictions—as did several EU countries, though to no avail. (The Europeans weren’t willing to be barred from transactions in dollars for the sake of their paltry trade with Iran.)  Meanwhile, Iran’s leaders continued to abide by the deal’s other terms—they continued to dismantle their nuclear program and to allow intrusive inspections. Finally, though, seeing no way to break through the sanctions, they resumed enriching uranium and, gradually, the other once-banned activities as well. They did so, citing Paragraph 36 of the JCPOA: If one signatory finds that others “were not meeting their commitments,” then, after consultations, it would have “grounds to cease performing its commitments.”  Republicans complained that Iran was violating the nuclear deal. The irony was twofold. First, Iran was only reacting to Trump’s abrogation of the deal, and doing so in a way that the deal allowed. Second, if the deal was as bad as the Republicans claimed it was, why did they see Iran’s violations as so egregious?  Then Biden won the White House. Having been Obama’s vice president, Biden of course supported the accord, as did his top aides, some of whom had been deeply involved in the talks with Iran during Obama’s administration. Many in Congress would have opposed a resumption, but the deal was a “multinational executive arrangement,” not a treaty, so Congress had no formal say in the matter. Another crucial fact: The Iranian leaders who’d signed the deal—President Hassan Rouhani and foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, both reformers, relatively speaking—were still in office. Elections, which would likely (and ultimately did) restore harder-line clerics to power, were scheduled for June. In the five months till then, Biden could have re-initialed the deal or at least reopened talks.  True, around this time, Tehran was stiffening its resistance to resuming diplomacy. European officials tried to get the ball rolling again. Iranians refused to meet with any Americans directly. The EU offered to be an intermediary. Preliminary talks got underway in Vienna, but they soon broke down. The impasse was almost juvenile. Biden officials wanted Tehran to dismantle some of its nuclear program before they lifted some sanctions; Iranian officials wanted Biden to make the first move. A reasonable case could be made that Washington should go first. After all, the U.S., not Iran, had scrapped the deal; Biden was in the process of reversing several of Trump’s executive orders. He could have done the same with JCPOA. But he didn’t. Why didn’t he?  I have asked this question in many quarters over the past two years. So have several other reporters. I have neither heard nor read a persuasive answer. Some officials have said Biden’s plate was full, as indeed it was, but he managed to extend New START—the U.S.-Russian nuclear arms reduction treaty, which Obama had signed in 2010 and which was about to expire—two weeks after Inauguration Day. He could have at least reopened talks on JCPOA with nearly as little difficulty.  It is now nearly impossible to get back on course with the Iran nuclear deal, and it has been for at least the past year. Tehran’s leaders have decided it’s not worth trying to suck up to the U.S., and for good reasons. First, they see no reason to trust Washington; even if Biden were to act in good faith (and, from their point of view, he hasn’t), his successor might not, especially if it’s Trump. Second, they have managed to strike alliances with other countries, notably Russia and China, whose leaders have also figured out ways to bypass U.S. sanctions.  This is another lesson of Trump’s great blunder. His withdrawal from the deal was part of a new policy called “maximum pressure.” As applied to Iran, the idea—encouraged by his then-new national security adviser and secretary of state, John Bolton and Mike Pompeo—was that the renewed sanctions would have one of two effects. In public, they said they hoped to push Tehran back to the table to negotiate a “better” nuclear deal. In fact, though, they knew there was no better deal to be had; their real motive was to devastate Iran’s economy so harshly that the people (or some faction of the elite) would rise up and oust the regime.  It didn’t work. Though its economy is far from robust, Iran is now exporting as much oil as it did just before Trump pulled out of the deal. It is on the verge of becoming a nuclear-armed power, if its rulers want it to be. And if they do, it will be Trump’s fault for pushing them over the ledge—and, to some degree, Biden’s for not doing enough to pull them back.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nDonald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, setting the stage for potential disasters. \nThe Iran nuclear deal required Iran to dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the US lifting economic sanctions. \nJoe Biden failed to reverse Trump's misstep, leaving Iran closer to building an atom bomb than ever before. \nIran has managed to bypass US sanctions and is now exporting as much oil as before Trump withdrew from the deal.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe article discusses the consequences of Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.\nIt explains the terms of the deal and how Iran has been forced to resume activities banned by the deal due to the US sanctions.\nIt also questions why Joe Biden has not taken steps to reverse Trump's misstep and re-initiate the deal.\nThe article argues that Trump's \"maximum pressure\" policy has failed to achieve its goal of ousting the Iranian regime, and that Iran is now closer to becoming a nuclear-armed power."

The article, if you feel the need to read it, is a blasphemous love letter from the author to Saint Buttigieg and his amazing mental faculties that allow him to read, be a man and contemplate faith. You know, the three basic things all men should be able to do. The paragraph that blew up the internet (below) is the literary equivalent of sniffing farts, as one incredible Twitter user pointed out. But the part that made me puke everywhere was the headline “Pete Buttigieg Loves God, Beer, and His Electric Mustang.” If you manage to get past this blatant propaganda, the rest reads as a hit-piece against anyone who thinks outside the neoliberal Marxist country-killer progressive crap normalized by Buttgieg and others since 2016. Firstly, no one likes an electric Mustang … certainly no one with an ounce of cool in their veins. Cool people like big trucks, old gas guzzlers that run on cowboy killers, Craig Morgan, John Rich songs, grit and patriotism. Secondly, Rule #1 of being a “serious journalist” is not to slobber all over your subject, because it completely undermines your ability to write without bias. I am all for being a fangirl. My friends and family often joke about how all I cover is “Yellowstone” and whatever country music star Morgan Wallen is up to, but that’s because I am not a serious journalist. And I certainly don’t see these two topics as God-like saviors of humanity. Finally, this author has no clue what having faith means in modern America. The paragraph that made me double puke reads, “Lefties these days are said to be less religious than right-wing evangelicals, but between Buttigieg, whose Episcopalianism grounds his decisionmaking [sic], and his boss, President Joe Biden, whose robust Catholicism drives his sincere effort to revive America’s soul, perhaps a religious left is rising again.” LOL. It’s not, babe. Quite the opposite is true. We are in the thick of a Christian conservative Great Awakening that seeks to undo the travesty of progressive politics and save America’s youth from the mass untreated mental illness glamorized by Hollywood and leftist politicians. When Buttigieg and Biden say publicly that God and the lives of the unborn are more important than their feelings, I might slightly try and believe the absolute garbage spewed by Wired. Better yet, when either of these men stand up and point at “gender-affirming care” for the child sterilization and mutilation it is, I’ll applaud them, even if I still think they’re fake Christians at heart. Until then, this article has officially been awarded my “Bigger Piece of Cringe Propaganda Crap” award for 2023.

The Supreme Court’s recent decision in the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health case overturned the 50-year-old Roe v Wade case and erased federal protection for abortion. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)  Why are woke progressives so angry? Why are they so hostile and intolerant to those who don’t agree with their views?  I roughly define the “woke” as far-left radicals committed to the cause of social justice, who embrace the concepts of critical race theory (CRT), and promote radical gender theory.  Conversely, many “traditionalist” thinkers are content to maintain their values and beliefs throughout the woke crusade. I define traditionalist, not as conservative, but a traditional “liberal.”  Traditional liberals value civility, sharing and debating alternative ideas. They are inclusive and view each individual as unique with intrinsic value. Life is centered around family, enduring friendships and frequently, but not always, religion. Above all, they are tolerant.  Zealous woke progressives, however, deride traditionalists as racists, bigots, MAGA republicans, probably evil, for failing to reject their beliefs and unconditionally accept the new world order as dictated by progressive dogma, no matter how irrational, hypocritical or divorced from reality. “This our America. We’re in charge now. Reality is what we say it is!”  Kim R. Holmes, Ph. D. of the Heritage Foundation describes the “illiberal” left, “They are supposedly great haters of bigotry but sometimes speak of Christians in the most bigoted manner imaginable, as if Christians were no better than fascists.”  If being “woke” means hyper-attuned to injustice everywhere, the movement displays a stunning lack of self-awareness to its own contradictions.  So long as their children are not indoctrinated in the concepts of CRT, lectured on radical gender theory, or harangued that climate change will destroy the planet in their lifetime, traditionalists sleep just fine. Live and let live.  This, however, does not work in reverse. A December 2021 survey reveals that individuals who have terminated relationships with family members or friends over political differences tend to be leftists who are severing those connections, as opposed to moderates or conservatives. To progressives, one’s character is defined, to the exclusion of all else, by one’s politics.  Rage is not a bug, it’s the defining feature of the illiberal left. Yet, if one is secure in their own personal beliefs and values, why are woke liberals so “triggered” by those who think differently?  A few observations.  Anger and rage fueled by underlying hate is linked with shame, humiliation and fear, and a reaction to a perceived threat.Hate often demonizes others by dismissing their humanity.  Hermes Solenzol, professor of neuroscience, explained in his article “The Toxicity of Woke Culture,” “Chronic fear, manifesting as anxiety and depression, saps our energy and leads to despair. Woke culture weaponized fear in several ways: as a misguided way to motivate activists, to attack its enemies, and as to punish those who deviate from its dogmas.”  Solenzol asserts that anger is a form of stress and can be contagious. “Activists pass it from one another, leading to a political culture steep in anxiety and distress. Chronic anger also becomes indistinguishable from hatred… and often leads to violence.”  In March at Stanford’s vaunted Law School. Invited speaker, Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan, was met with a revolting display of vulgar taunts and insults from the students resulting in a heckler’s veto.  More recently NCAA swimming champion Riley Gaines spoke at San Francisco State University about the injustice to women forced to compete against biological men claiming to be transgender.  In 2022 NCAA championships, Gaines tied newly-transitioned Lia Thomas (formerly William Thomas), who came out as transgender after competing at U Penn as a “mediocre” male swimmer the previous three years.  After her speech, violent protesters stormed in. Gaines was assaulted and forced to seek refuge for several hours in a locked classroom. The horde demanded a ransom payment for her release.  On shame, Solenzol writes, “Shaming people for who they are (men, White, privileged) turns them into enemies, because they can’t change who they are. It is an attack on their self-esteem and their dignity.  To the radical woke, those who simply disagree are not worthy of dignity or respect, so physical violence is justified.  What appears to drive the unhinged progressive rage is fear. The mere existence of others who simply possess views contrary to their own are nothing less than a threat to their own existence.  Woke progressives simply cannot tolerate those who refuse to accept them on their terms. Society must not only validate their skewed concept of reality, but celebrate its ascendency.  Non-believers are unworthy of engaging in a rational debate because doing so would acknowledge the existence of alternative views. They are simply scorned as unenlightened flat earthers.  It is not only speech that causes harm; opposing thoughts, opinions and ideas, are just as damaging and will not be permitted.  Along with fear, progressives tend to be less happy than conservatives. A 2022 survey suggests that, compared to conservatives, liberals are about 15 and 18 percentage points less likely to be “completely satisfied” with their lives, and with their mental health, respectively.  Two factors account for these disparities: marital status and family satisfaction. Conservatives, by 20 percentage points, are more likely to be married and 18 percentage points more likely to be satisfied with their families, compared to liberals. The takeaway is marriage and family strongly correlate with happiness and mental health.  These stabilizing influences are largely rejected by progressives. True happiness, they believe, lies outside the institutions of marriage and family. For most men and women, happiness is achieved from a life that involves marriage and family.  The life anchors for the more self-possessed tend to be one’s vocation, marriage, family and friendships; deep connections with others and a grounding in basic Judeo-Christian values. Subordinating oneself to a faith, spouse, or raising children compels personal growth, the cultivation of gratitude and humility.  Is it the chronically depressed who are drawn to radical left politics? Or is it the toxic pessimism of woke ideology that propels the content into misery? Those trapped in despair may feel they have nothing to lose and find it easier to blame America for their unhappiness.  Titus Techera underscores progressive’s proclivity for activism over traditionalism in Law & Liberty, “The full politicization of human life cannot happen while people care about their families more than about politics. People who have no families are presumed not to be able to resist politicization, since they cannot dedicate themselves to the love and friendship that makes private life worth living…”  Maybe the fear and desperation exhibited by the unrestrained rage of the radical woke is simply an anguished cry for connection and meaning.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  The hypothetical reasonable person, a scholar once observed, is “the common law’s most enduring legal fiction.” Roaming the landscape of American jurisprudence, the reasonable person crops up everywhere, from negligence lawsuits to criminal cases, including those involving self-defense. Indeed, imposing liability often pivots on what juries and judges believe this imaginary individual would have done, believed or otherwise understood under similar circumstances as a real person.  But, during oral arguments last month before the U.S. Supreme Court in the true-threats case of Counterman v. Colorado, several conservative justices hinted that the reasonable person’s days might be numbered.  Specifically, they voiced skepticism about letting jurors use a reasonable-person standard to decide when statements constitute threats of violence unprotected by the First Amendment. As The Hill reported, they fretted that today’s reasonable person, as envisioned by jurors, may be “too hypersensitive” and thus might wrongly find threats where none exist.  This notion fits snugly within dual cultural and conservative narratives in which Americans are growing emotionally thin-skinned and colleges are spawning what former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions alliteratively called “sanctimonious, sensitive, supercilious snowflakes.” However, there is no reason why the sensibilities of the mythical reasonable person cannot or should not evolve with the times.  But first, here’s why the reasonable person appears center stage in Counterman. The issue that the court faces (and probably will decide by summer) regards what the government must prove to establish that a statement is a true threat.  Two options loom large. The first would require the government to show only that an objectively reasonable person — one in the position of an intended or foreseeable recipient of a statement — would understand such a statement as a threat. The second option would go further: It would demand that the government prove something about the speaker’s subjective state of mind (a mens rea or guilty mind requirement).  What does that mean? It would require the government to prove that speakers (1) actually intended their words to be understood as threats; (2) knew their words would be taken as threats; or (3) acted recklessly by consciously ignoring the risk they would be understood as threats.  The justices addressed these mens rea options during oral argument, when attorney John Elwood asserted on Billy Raymond Counterman’s behalf that adding a mens rea requirement would guard against “criminalizing misunderstanding.”  A jury convicted Counterman in 2017 under a Colorado statute for stalking that caused serious emotional distress to singer-songwriter Coles Whalen based on what the prosecution termed “waves of Facebook messages that escalated into alarming claims and aggressive invectives.” A Colorado appellate court upheld the verdict in 2021, concluding Counterman’s messages were true threats unprotected by the First Amendment. In doing so, it applied “an objective test” — the reasonable-person standard — and did not consider anything about Counterman’s subjective intent or state of mind regarding what he said to Whalen.  That seemed to bother some of the court’s conservatives. “Who is the reasonable person?” bluntly asked Justice Amy Coney Barrett of Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. She elaborated, querying whether it was a “general reasonable person” or whether “if something happens on a college campus, is it the reasonable college student, which might be different?”  Barrett added that maybe “nowadays people would be more sensitive” to certain content. This subtly tracks the snowflake motif noted earlier, in which today’s students are seen as “increasingly fragile and unable to deal with the friction and disappointment of social life.”  Justice Clarence Thomas similarly asserted that “we’re more hypersensitive about different things now, and people could feel threatened in different ways.” The court’s longest-serving justice was concerned that “reasonableness […] seems to now be on a sliding scale.” Justice Neil Gorsuch chimed in, noting “we live in a world in which people are […] maybe increasingly sensitive.” In doing so, he referenced the controversial concept of trigger warnings given by some professors in college classrooms to protect sensitive students (a subject perhaps on his mind because it made national headlines just two weeks prior to oral argument).  In short, the trio asserted that, unless the government must prove something about a speaker’s subjective mental state when uttering an allegedly threatening statement, it may be too easy in today’s increasingly sensitive world to strip a person of First Amendment protection under the reasonable-person standard.  There’s no doubt that adding a mens rea requirement to the true-threats doctrine would bolster First Amendment protection for speakers who use ambiguous language and claim they were joking or misunderstood. But it doesn’t follow that the Supreme Court should throw the reasonable person under the fast-moving bus of today’s culture simply because people may be more sensitive than they were in the past. Indeed, the reasonable person evolves with the times. To wit, today’s genderless reasonable person once was a reasonable man, with that shift largely occurring in the 1970s and 1980s.  Furthermore, as Phil Weiser told the court, the reasonable person is not an “eggshell,” cracking easily, or a person with “essentially idiosyncratic characteristics.” In other words, it is the perspective of a reasonable — not unreasonable — person in the position of the recipient of an alleged threat that jurors must consider.  Ultimately, it’s true that the reasonable person is a legal fiction and that people will differ about whether ambiguous messages can reasonably be understood as illicit threats or hyperbole. But oral argument in Counterman revealed something else: the belief among some justices that society is now too delicate to apply a reasonable-person standard in a way that adequately safeguards First Amendment speech interests. Today’s cultural battles over free expression and the alleged thinning of the American skin thus may well influence how the court defines a true threat later this summer.

Levin College of Law and a Brechner Eminent Scholar in Mass Communication in the College of Journalism and Communications.

        "text": "As Democrats were falling over themselves calling Donald Trump an idiot after his CNN town hall, the Biden White House was urgently working on something else: Vindicating Trump’s immigration policy. In fact, the White House that had resisted for years acknowledging it had created a crisis on the border was scrambling on Wednesday to publish a new regulation that looks suspiciously like the Trump policy it had fought to abolish. Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning. “The Biden administration has finalized a sweeping restriction on asylum that it plans to use to ramp up swift deportations of migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border,” CBS reported. “The regulation published Wednesday resembles a Trump-era policy struck down in federal court that Mr. Biden decried in 2020.” That Trump regulation was Title 42, which thanks to Biden’s opposition, was lifted on Thursday and threatened to spur a surge of migrants moving northward from Central and South America. Biden unveils a get-tough asylum policy “I don’t like Title 42,” Biden once said of the Trump White House policy that allowed the federal government to quickly turn away and deport migrants claiming refugee status during the pandemic. When Biden came into office, he promised to manage the border in more humane ways. The new administration eventually saw apprehensions of border-crossers hit record highs, and they remain at near-record highs today. Now Biden’s Department of Homeland Security is busy training hundreds of U.S. asylum officers how to enforce the administration’s new restriction on asylum seekers, reports CBS News: “The regulation, which is expected to be challenged in federal court, will be a dramatic shift in asylum policy, disqualifying migrants from U.S. protection if they fail to request refugee status in another country, such as Mexico, on their journey to the southern border.” Republican governors who transported migrants to major blue cities in the Midwest and the East have also seen their policies vindicated by recent events. © Joel Angel Juarez, The Arizona Republic-USA TODAY N Migrants and asylum seekers from Peru wait for Border Patrol agents to pick them up after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in San Luis, Ariz., on May 12, 2023. I personally don’t support bussing immigrants as a political strategy. I think there are moral considerations here that transcend politics. But as pure policy, it has been highly successful at spreading the burden of mass and virtually unchecked immigration to other parts of the country beyond the Sunbelt. Biden isn't prepared for Title 42 end: Biden wants us to believe the border is prepared for end of Title 42. Anyone buying that? AMLO hypocritical on immigration: Mexico's president should spare us his anger over DeSantis' 'immoral' anti-immigration law Bussing migrants activated big-city mayors So successful is the policy that Democrats have begun to adopt it. The redistribution of migrants began with Republican Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas, Ron DeSantis of Florida and then-Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. They launched the strategy to make Democratic cities feel the burden of dealing with Biden’s weak immigration policies. In so doing, they turned the Democratic mayors of Chicago and New York into full-throated members of their own choir, demanding the White House do more to control the border. Stressed over work? Give yourself a 'micro-break' to avoid burnout. Feeling lonely? Government can't solve our 'loneliness epidemic,' but we can. It's easier than you think. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has issued an emergency declaration that will allow her city to tap into special funds to accommodate the growing numbers of new migrants arriving in the city. She also called on Illinois’ Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker to mobilize the state National Guard. Her successor, Brandon Johnson, who will take over May 15, has called on the federal government to provide more assistance. Chicago has given sanctuary to more than 8,000 migrants since August 2022, reports ABC7-Chicago. With migrant housing overflowing, more than 450 immigrants are sleeping in Chicago police stations, the news channel reported. Trump, the GOP are winning on immigration In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams is criticizing Joe Biden for how he has mishandled the border crisis and said the situation has grown dire. New York is spending billions to house new immigrants and will not be able to sustain it, Adams said. The city is “being destroyed,” he added. In turn, Adams has begun to imitate Republican governors by bussing migrants to other counties in northern New York State.

        "text": "In case it wasn’t completely obvious that former President Donald Trump is scared about a challenge from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, he made it crystal clear last week.  After DeSantis’ official launch of his presidential campaign, Trump countered with several bizarre posts. On social media, he posted a deepfake video of DeSantis’ Twitter Spaces event co-hosted by Twitter boss Elon Musk.  It’s alarming that the parody didn’t make bigger news, considering how appalling it is coming from a former president of the United States − and someone vying to be president again.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  More: Freshly indicted Trump has gone from mocking DeSantis to begging him not to run. SAD!  The deepfake video with artificial intelligent-generated voices mimicked DeSantis and Musk. Also making “appearances” were Democratic donor George Soros, Adolf Hitler and the devil.  The clip ends with a voice that sounds like Trump saying in part, \"Ron DeSanctimonious can kiss my big, beautiful 2024 presidential a--.\"  No thanks, Trump  As journalist and essayist H.L. Mencken famously observed, “Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.”  © Alex Brandon, AP Former President Donald Trump takes a call on the driving range before the second round of the LIV Golf at Trump National Golf Club, Saturday, May 27, 2023, in Sterling, Va.  These are the kind of sophomoric stunts that Trump pulls. And it’s what he’ll continue to do in the months ahead.  Conservatives need to think hard about what they want heading into 2024.  A GOP divided: Tired Trump fades at CPAC while DeSantis rises at Reagan Library  In addition to the deepfake, shortly after DeSantis’ announcement, Trump wrote the following on his site Truth Social: “ ‘Rob,’ My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working (TRUTH!), yours does not! (per my conversation with Kim Jung Un, of North Korea, soon to become my friend!).”  It sounds unhinged and nonsensical, but the Trump campaign reportedly later shared it in an email to supporters.  Did DeSantis’ Twitter launch have hiccups? Yes. It took about half an hour before it actually got started. It reflects more poorly on Musk than DeSantis, however.  ‘Big demand’ for Ron DeSantis  DeSantis’ team has smartly played up how the more than 630,000 initial listeners “broke” the internet.  Others have, too. Political consultant Liz Mair, who has worked with Republican candidates, observed that this speaks to the “big demand” to hear DeSantis – and that it’s why Trump, President Joe Biden and much of the media fear a DeSantis run.  Who wants Trump? Many Republicans don't want Trump to be the 2024 GOP nominee. But Democrats sure do.  Once the announcement got underway, DeSantis covered a lot of issues, including education and immigration, in a live discussion that lasted more than an hour.  “He did 75+ minutes on pure policy,” wrote former Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. “Trump could never do that.”  In the past week, more than 4 million people have listened to the Spaces event.  For an opening rally, that’s not too shabby. And the fundraising numbers are in DeSantis’ favor: His campaign says it raised $8.2 million in the first 24 hours – nearly $2 million more than Biden raised in the first day of his 2020 bid.  Meanwhile, the Trump clan posts fake videos  Not to be outdone by his father, Donald Trump Jr. recently shared another fake video.  This one superimposes DeSantis’ face on that of Steve Carell’s character Michael Scott from “The Office.” The clip is one where the character is made fun of for mistakenly wearing a woman’s suit.  More: Donald Trump wants you to think he's constantly the victim. Maybe he's just a bad dude.  It’s really not funny (although the actual TV show is).  Trump’s in the entertainment business, and he has used his talents in that arena to create a cult following around his personality. His core supporters will be loyal to Trump no matter what.

I hope Trump will find out that a lot of Republicans don’t appreciate him taking such a low road to go after DeSantis − a proven winner and someone who can deliver on his promises.

The city is wrangling with two dueling lawsuits as it tries to manage a homelessness crisis that has converted its downtown into a tent city housing hundreds of people under the blazing desert sun just as summer temperatures soar into the 90s. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin, File) PHOENIX (AP) — Phoenix is facing dueling lawsuits as it tries to manage a crisis of homelessness that has converted its downtown into a tent city housing hundreds of people as summer temperatures soar. The city was ordered by the local Superior Court to clear out the downtown encampment because it is considered a “public nuisance.” But Arizona's American Civil Liberties Union argued in a federal lawsuit that the city is violating the constitutional rights of unhoused people by slowly clearing the area known as “The Zone.” The dilemma faced by Phoenix is an example of the balance municipalities across the United States now must strike when trying to satisfy the demands of residents and business owners while respecting the rights of homeless people. Seattle faced a similar situation in 2020 when a woman sued the city, alleging that a sweep of the homeless encampment where she lived would violate her rights. In New Mexico, as the city of Albuquerque worked to prohibit panhandling along roadways, the ACLU fought for that right. U.S. District Court Judge G. Murray Snow on Friday declined a request by the ACLU to declare Phoenix in contempt of a ruling he issued in December that ordered the city to refrain from enforcing camping and sleeping bans against people who cannot get shelter. He said he would not bar the city from further cleanups at the encampment site pending another hearing set for next month. © Provided by The Associated Press FILE - A man sweeps the sidewalk as tents and crude lean-tos crowd the sidewalks where many homeless people live along the streets on March 24, 2020, in Phoenix.

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin, File) The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that homeless people cannot be criminalized for sleeping outside if no alternatives exist. But a Maricopa County Superior Court judge overseeing the case filed by business owners and residents who say the encampment is a public nuisance ordered Phoenix in March to make a plan to clear the tent city quickly. By May 10, the city started the first round of the plan, cleaning one block of the encampment. But the ACLU said city employees seized and destroyed the property of homeless individuals and refused to let them return to the area after it was cleaned. “The city should be held accountable for its conduct before any future cleanings can take place,\" Jared Keenan, legal director for the ACLU of Arizona, said in a statement. The city has said it “vehemently disagrees” with the ACLU's assessment. Amid the back and forth in court, Phoenix area advocates have scrambled for more shelter space for homeless people as the hot season begins. Shelter space in an old motel came online Friday, but with just 52 beds it’s hardly enough as Arizona’s largest county announces the first four heat associated deaths of the year. More than a third of the 425 people who died from heat-associated causes in Maricopa County last year were homeless. Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, a former social worker, has been seeking new solutions to Arizona’s housing crisis. She successfully pushed for $150 million to be included in Arizona’s Housing Trust Fund in the state’s recently approved budget to shore up rent and utility assistance programs, eviction prevention, and build new shelters and affordable housing.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  The wonderful thing about America is that almost anyone can grow up to become president. The reality is that only some people should.  The Constitution doesn’t demand much from the person who wants to be considered the most powerful leader on the planet. A president must be at least 35 years old, born in the United States and a resident for at least 14 years. That’s it. Voters decide what else it takes to qualify for the job.  The checklist should include an even temperament. The president commands the world’s most powerful military force, including nuclear weapons. Presidents don’t have to ask for anyone’s permission to order a launch. It is their decision and theirs alone.  A president should be free of emotional and psychological disorders. For example, they should not be pathological egoists. What’s good for the country must always come first.  They should be capable of empathy, diplomacy and all-around good judgment, and have the ability to work constructively in our two-party system. And, in case it comes up, no one should be able to run for the presidency from prison.  We could add much more to the checklist, but as the 2024 election cycle begins, one quality stands out. Presidents must be trustworthy.  There are few times, if any, in our history when truth has been more important. Misinformation and disinformation are the matches that light insurrection, violence, domestic terrorism, extreme partisanship, bigotry, mass shootings and wild conspiracy theories. Disinformation has created distrust in the electoral system, itself a threat to democracy.  There has never been a time when disinformation has been able to spread so quickly. Mark Twain gets credit for pointing out, “A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.” But that might be untrue, too. Several notable people have made the same point. For example, Jonathan Swift wrote in 1710, “Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after.” By the time truth catches up, it’s too late, Swift said: The lie has had its effect.  None of our forebears imagined how rapidly lies travel today.  Donald Trump’s irrepressible lying should immediately disqualify him from another term as president. The Washington Post tracked his lies during his four years in office and counted nearly 30,600 false or misleading statements. He is an unapologetic and irredeemable fabricator. Presidential historian Michael Beschloss says, “I have never seen a president in American history who has lied so continuously and so outrageously as Donald Trump, period.“  Because truth and trustworthiness are so important, it’s disappointing that Trump’s principal opponent for the Republican nomination, at least for now, is another man the American people can’t trust. As soon as he stepped on the national stage, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis employed the “illusory truth effect,” where a politician repeats a false claim over and over again until people believe it’s true. DeSantis’s lie is that he’s freedom’s champion. He is not.  Under his leadership, he says, Florida is “on the front lines of freedom” and has become a “citadel of freedom,” “freedom’s linchpin” and “freedom’s vanguard.” He has written a book titled “The Courage to be Free” and promoted his budget as the “Framework for Freedom.” “Everything he’s doing, he boasts, is about freedom,” points out Michael Tomasky, editor of The New Republic. But “DeSantis’s idea of freedom, for a lot of Floridians, looks more like chains: women seeking reproductive freedom, transgender children, school librarians, academics who dare to cross the whiff-of-1984 lines he and his legislature have drawn, and anybody who is sympathetic to any of those groups. DeSantis loves freedom—for people who love DeSantis.”  DeSantis claims Florida is “the place where woke goes to die.” Instead, it’s where authoritarianism lives.  A traditional Republican wants the government to stay out of people’s business. But DeSantis has produced a nanny state where his government dictates what books people should read, what’s taught in schools, what rights women have over their bodies, what advice investment advisers are allowed to give to their clients and what Mickey Mouse can say and do.  He has created an environment in which a complaint from one parent just persuaded an elementary school to keep students from reading “The Hill We Climb,” the inspirational poem delivered at President Biden’s inauguration by American youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman. The parent complained the poem “is not educational and have indirectly [sic] hate messages,” while misidentifying Oprah Winfrey as the poem’s author. The complaint was filed just a week after DeSantis signed a law ordering schools to take books off shelves within five days after a parental complaint. School officials then determine whether the book should be banned permanently.  Meanwhile, as DeSantis poses as commandant of America’s cultural wars, Florida “continues to languish toward the bottom of state rankings assessing the quality of health care, school funding, long-term eldercare, and other areas key to a successful society,” according to TIME magazine.  President Joe Biden isn’t blameless in the truth department. CNN reported that Biden made several false claims during his first year as president, primarily during ad-libs. But he also made “multiple false claims about important policy matters.”  “Biden never came close to making a dozen false claims in a single speech, let alone five dozen false claims in one address, as Trump once did,” CNN’s fact checker concluded. “In fact, the total number of Biden false claims so far is in the dozens, while Trump delivered well over 1,000 total false claims in his own first year and more than 3,000 the next year. So Biden is no Trump. With that said, dozens of false claims from the president of the United States is not nothing.”  Of all the qualities we need in a president today, none is more important than trust. The nation is starving for it.  William Becker is executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project (PCAP), a nonpartisan climate policy think tank unaffiliated with the White House. He is a former senior official at the U.S. Department of Energy and the author of several reports and books, including “100-Day Action Plan to Save the Planet” and “The Creeks Will Rise: People Co-Existing with Floods.” <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe Constitution requires very little to become president, but voters should consider an even temperament, empathy, diplomacy, and good judgement. \nDonald Trump's irrepressible lying should disqualify him from another term as president.\nRon DeSantis has employed the \"illusory truth effect\" to falsely portray himself as a champion of freedom.\nJoe Biden has made false claims, but nowhere near the amount of Donald Trump.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe article discusses the qualities that should be present in a president, such as an even temperament, empathy, diplomacy, and trustworthiness.\nIt highlights the dangers of misinformation and disinformation, and how Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis have failed to meet the standards of trustworthiness.\nThe article also emphasizes the importance of truth in the current political climate, and how Biden has made fewer false claims than Trump.\nFinally, it argues that trust is the most important quality for a president today."

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  Right after the 1994 New York governor election, my high school English teacher assigned us to write a letter to the Pataki administration opposing his proposed tax cut.  Our teacher fed us the standard teachers union line, which was that a tax cut would reduce state education spending and thus harm our schools and shift a greater burden onto local taxpayers. We were supposed to put this in our own words as concerned children and plead with Albany to keep our parents’ taxes high.  LIBERAL POLICIES ARE MAKING THE AMERICAN DREAM UNAFFORDABLE  I raised my hand and said that, actually, I think greater local control of education is good — especially for those who didn’t trust former Gov. George Pataki! The teacher said, “Look, I don’t want you to make this a political debate,” to which I responded, “Isn’t lobbying against a tax cut political?”  The teacher rejected this as false equivalence.  For the past nearly 30 years, I have seen exactly this conceit play out a thousand times: Liberals in a professional liberal bubble believing that their conservative opponents are politicizing something while their own side is being totally apolitical, thank you very much.  Check out the Washington Post’s latest conservatives pounce piece on the prosecution of Daniel Penny, who has been charged with manslaughter for taking down and restraining an aggressive, mentally ill panhandler named Jordan Neely and apparently causing Neely’s death with a chokehold.  Substack writer Chris Bray aptly sums up the predictable Washington Post piece, which is part of a genre:  You’ll be shocked to hear that this one’s a seizing on piece: “The political right has seized on police statements that Neely had 44 previous arrests for offenses such as assault, disorderly conduct and fare evasion.” Not to mention the attempted kidnapping of a seven year-old, but let’s not be right-wing about this. Let’s not POUNCE on the mere act of kidnapping of a child, Nazis!…The premise of the story is that the political right is cynically using the controversy to “score points,” and yes, the story actually uses scoring points: “The financial support Penny’s legal team has received is due, in part, to the coverage of right-leaning media outlets and Republican politicians using his case to score points on the latest front of the culture war, experts say.”  Yes, it’s an “experts say” and “conservatives pounce” story, which means it is simply just a liberal opinion piece disguised as a news story. That’s not shocking. What’s shocking is how banal the central opinion is in this thinly veiled opinion piece. Basically, the opinion is that conservative politicians are (mis-)using the story as a way to make their point that crime and disorder are on the rise.  The thing is that crime and disorder are on the rise, especially in the New York City subway, but also in other cities around the country. This is a valid political point because public policy is almost assuredly behind the rise in crime. (Consider the decriminalization of minor subway crimes, the triumph of “progressive prosecutors,” and the COVID lockdowns, which ruined the lives of people who, in turn, take up antisocial behavior, and other policies). Yet to the Washington Post, conservative politicians talking about the disorder and crime amounts to politicizing something — “Penny’s case has been injected into the bloodstream of partisan politics,” the article argues. And as the headline makes clear, the injection is being administered by conservatives like DeSantis.  There was no “Liberals seize on Jordan Neely’s Death” story in the Washington Post. There was instead an “After NY subway chokehold death, protesters call for an arrest.”  That “protesters call” piece didn’t include the words “liberal,” “progressive,” or “Left” — compared to the 13 appearances of the word “conservatives” and about 10 mentions of the “political right” or the “far right” in the “conservatives hail” piece.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  You see, the “lock him up!” protesters aren’t really political; they’re just protesters. The “don’t lock him up” folks are all ideologues.  I don’t think this is conscious bias. I think that in newsrooms of major newspapers, the left-wing view is seen as standard and noncontroversial, while the right-wing view is seen as ideology.

        "text": "© Hector Amezcua/Sacramento Bee/via AP Dawn Basciano holds up legal documents while speaking during public comments at the California Reparations Task Force meeting, Wednesday, March 29, 2023, in Sacramento, Calif. She said her ancestors had land in Coloma taken by the state parks system. - Hector Amezcua/Sacramento Bee/via AP  The Democratic Governor of California, Gavin Newsom – a potential Presidential candidate next year – set up a reparations task force in his state in 2020 to consider the case for compensation for the historical wrongs and discrimination experienced by California’s black community. Now the task force has reported and suggested that individuals should be given up to $1.2 million each in recompense.  The cost of this, estimated in hundreds of billions of dollars, has met with a cool response from the Governor and the hard-pressed taxpayers of California, where public services and quality of life have been in free fall in recent years.  Among those qualifying for compensation are the descendants of black slaves. This is curious because California itself was a “free state”. It was part of that great swathe of territory – the American South West – taken by the United States in the war with Mexico between 1846-48, and it entered the American Union in 1850 with a constitution that outlawed slavery in the state. It remained part of the Union – “the North” – during the Civil War. The only people held as slaves in California up to that time were the slaves of native American tribes in what became the north of the state.  So today’s tax-payers in California are being asked to pay for the historic wrongs committed by the slave-holding Southern states – Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and suchlike – even though their ancestors in California never held slaves. No wonder so few of them welcomed this report with glee.  After the Civil War and the emancipation of 4 million slaves in the South, a relatively small number of them went west. It is another curious fact of American history that perhaps as many as a third of cowboys, in their heyday between about 1875 and 1910, were black men who’d left the South. But California was never one of the major destinations of the “Great Migration” of African Americans from the South during and after the First World War. The vast majority of these went to the north-east and mid-west, to cities like New York, Detroit and Chicago.  Today, blacks make up only 6.5 per cent of the Californian population, which is about half the proportion in America as a whole. Throughout black history, whether in slavery or freedom, African Americans have made up approximately 12 per cent of the population of the US.  Meanwhile, the historic wrongs that really could have been laid at the door of Californians were not part of the task force’s remit. The internment in California of tens of thousands of Japanese during the Second World War, the majority of them citizens of the US, is relatively well-known. They were sent to camps for the duration, losing their livelihoods, and in many cases, their homes. They fought for this wrong to be recognised for decades after the war, eventually receiving apologies and relatively small sums in reparation.  Less well-known is the case of the Chinese. As many as 200,000 Chinese came to California, first in the 1849 Gold Rush and then to build the railroads across the West. They were subject to vicious local discrimination and racial violence. Debates after the Civil War over whether to grant the suffrage to freed black slaves were influenced by California’s concern that it should not thereby be forced to grant the vote and other civil rights to the mostly male Chinese workers it had absorbed.  The 15th Amendment to the Constitution, passed in 1869 and designed to secure black voting rights, was a weaker measure because of Californian opposition to a more generous grant of fundamental rights to all citizens, the Chinese included. Indeed, it was so weak that it was easily evaded by Southern states intent on disenfranchising their black citizens in the decades that followed.  Leaders among the Californian black community are themselves stretching back to the aftermath of the Civil War to demand the equivalent in today’s money of “40 acres and a mule”. This was the cry that went up among the freed slaves when the war ended in 1865. Despite what some black Californians may believe and say now, it was never “a pledge” made by the federal government in Washington DC.  Today’s advocates of black reparations misunderstand the demand for land and the historic situation, in any case. The freed people were not calling for compensation for slavery: they wanted their forty acres so they could be independent and free of the influence of former slaveholders who still owned the land across the South. They wanted to work in family units on family farms, not in the gang labour of slavery. In the event, they became sharecroppers, sharing the proceeds of their labour with the white landowners.  With the exception of a few of the most radical members of Abraham Lincoln’s Republican Party, hardly anyone outside the community of former slaves supported the break-up of the great estates of the South: to have expropriated the owners of the land would have started the Civil War all over again. And this has been the pattern ever since in American History: Americans have been willing to grant ever-increasing rights to ever-increasing communities in their midst, whether those communities are national, ethnic, religious or gender-based. But they have been far less amenable to the idea of giving them property, payments, or compensation.  Martin Luther King held together a great national coalition of all communities while he led the cause of civil rights in the mid-1960s in America. When, after their achievement, he turned his fire on social inequality and “levelling up” he lost his hold on many whites who had supported him hitherto.  American History can be characterised as the pursuit of political, civil and social equality. But America has also been dedicated to economic individualism, opportunity, self-help, and low taxes. California itself grew into the wealthiest and most creative state of the Union on the basis of those values.  For that reason, and with many precedents from the American past in mind, it is most unlikely that the reparations calculated and advocated in this report will ever be paid.

        "text": "© Provided by News Nation   So, when I heard that his lawyers had reached out to the Department of Justice and tried to set up a meeting to talk, I thought that was a good idea. After all, defense attorneys regularly plead their cases to the DOJ, outside of a courtroom, either in an effort to avoid an indictment or to have charges reduced or dismissed, etc.  But then I actually read the letter written by attorneys John Rowley and James Trusty. It’s just one paragraph long and really more partisan screed than real lawyers making real arguments.  It’s the sort of argument the former president’s political allies might make, but not something lawyers should be doing.  It reads in part: “No President of the United States has ever, in the history of our country, been baselessly investigated in such an outrageous and unlawful fashion.”  Putting aside the fact that he isn’t president any longer, there is nothing about the investigation itself that is baseless or outrageous.  The question is whether charges should be brought for allegedly lying and obstructing in response to a criminal subpoena, in addition to other possible charges, and his lawyers’ goal should be to try to avoid charges at all costs.  That’s why I presume they were asking for a meeting in the hope of persuading the DOJ to not bring charges. The same DOJ, by the way, that decided to defend the former president against E. Jean Carroll and her defamation lawsuit against Trump and the same DOJ that has been defending the former president in the case brought by former senior FBI agent Peter Strzok after he was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia interference probe for sending anti-Trump text messages to a colleague and then later fired from the bureau.  In both of those cases, the DOJ made the decision to defend the former president over the furious objections of many on the left. So, one would think his lawyers would know this is a DOJ that will at the least hear them out if they want to make legal arguments.  Instead, the lawyers just “request a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss the ongoing injustice that is being perpetrated by your special counsel and his prosecutors.”  There were no specifics about the supposedly justices, just unsupported attacks on the investigation.  Now, one might expect this sort of rhetoric from Trump himself trying to make it political. But these are lawyers who are supposed to make legal arguments, which of course, none of this is.  Look, we’ll see if the DOJ agrees to meet with the lawyers. If they do, it would likely be with special counsel Jack Smith himself and not AG Garland.  If the goal was just to rile up his political base, he may have scored some small points. But if, on the other hand, the goal was to make a real legal effort to try to avoid an indictment, this does the former president a disservice and his lawyers should know better.

Tykocinski was scolded for multiple tweets he \"liked\" that criticized COVID-19 vaccines and gender reassignment surgery. Joseph G. Cacchione, Thomas Jefferson University’s CEO, was critical and said he was “disappointed,” calling it a “careless use” of Twitter.  “At his level, he is held to a higher standard and should have known better,” Cacchione said in a message last week, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The announcement was sent to the university’s faculty, employees, and students.  CLARENCE THOMAS AND NEO-PAZZISM  But what is so disappointing? COVID-19 skepticism and gender reassignment surgery are two very important things to be extremely critical about. Our leaders and experts led us astray on vaccines, making all kinds of wrong promises to manipulate public opinion to ensure compliance. Pertaining to gender reassignment surgery, the lives of children are at stake and vulnerable to the irreparable harm of agenda-driven medical professionals.  But instead of staged outrage and political theater over Tykocinski’s Twitter, everyone should question Cacchione’s words. What standard did he violate? And “known better” about what? The whole “trust the science” regarding COVID-19 vaccines was complete hogwash, predicated on junk science and propaganda. Even Dr. Deborah Birx, the former White House COVID-19 response coordinator, criticized vaccine efficacy and claimed they were overplayed. So what mythical standard did Tykocinski violate by being skeptical of vaccines?  Moreover, what about gender ideology? Are Cacchione and Thomas Jefferson University so compromised by the gender reassignment industrial complex and lobby that they are beholden to these medical experimentations on young children that cause irreparable damage to many children who aren’t even teenagers yet? Tykocinski isn’t allowed to express cynicism over that? Nothing other than an adherence to radical left-wing ideologies is deemed acceptable.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  It’s indicative of the kind of aggression and bullying the Left uses to force compliance. Cacchione’s communication to the school was ultimately a message to Tykocinski, warning him that he disapproved of such opinions. It was an intimidation tactic that has led many to get “canceled.” The faux controversy was predicated on Tykocinski expressing views that differ from contemporary left-wing political orthodoxy. Tykocinski had every right to like any tweets he wanted. He should not be subjected to thinking a particular way and forced to subscribe to a particular ideology solely because of his profession. This is especially true given just how wrong that ideology was proven to be during the pandemic.  Unfortunately, Tykocinski backed down and issued an apology. While I don’t know for sure, I could only imagine that his job was threatened unless he did so. It is the kind of oppression that the Left’s academic elitists use to get their way, promote their narratives, and advance radical agendas. They weaponize their authority to engage in extremist indoctrination and the brainwashing of students. And as Cacchione’s sanctimonious comments showed, there is only one proper way to think.

Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  The kicker: the candidate won't be Donald J. Trump.  And that is a really big deal.  From CNN back in February:  \"The deep-pocketed network associated with billionaire Charles Koch is preparing to throw its money and weight behind a single Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential primary â in a move that could significantly reshape the GOP field.  Americans for Prosperity Action, the main political arm of the Koch network, âis prepared to support a candidate in the Republican presidential primary who can lead our country forward, and who can win,â Emily Seidel, the CEO of Americans for Prosperity and a top adviser at AFP Action, wrote in a memo released Sunday.  The memo does not mention Donald Trump, but an official with AFP Action confirmed to CNN that the network is not planning to support the former presidentâs White House bid.\"  Could the Koch network have the money and influence to beat Donald Trump?  A short answer: no. And even if they did, it could backfire - bigly.  I say that because Donald Trump transformed the Republican Party from being a pro-business, low taxes party to a MAGA-centric populist party.  While the Koch network and MAGA share some similarities - they both want a restrained foreign policy (there are some exceptions for sure) and share some libertarian commonalities - that is where the similarities end.  Where the Kochs and Trump diverge in a major way is trade. Team Koch was very much against China tariffs and is very much for free trade across the board, with no exceptions - like the GOP was before Donald Trump ran in 2015.  The challenge for the Koch Brothers is Donald Trump brought in so many new voters into the GOP that those voters are uniquely tied to him. Even if Koch could sway the 2024 GOP primary and somehow hand the election to, say, Mike Pence or Nikki Haley or someone else we all know, MAGA voters would be enraged. It could even be enough to get Donald Trump to go Teddy Roosevelt and form his own version of a Bull Moose Party and run as a third-party candidate.  Tred carefully, mighty Koch brothers.

        "text": "© Provided by The Guardian Photograph: Logan Cyrus/AFP/Getty Images  Since Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis took office in 2019 and embarked on his culture wars, lawsuits from various communities whose rights have been violated have been stacking up against the far-right Republican.  As DeSantis fights the lawsuits with what critics have described as a blank check from the state’s supermajority Republican legislature, the mounting legal costs have come heavily at the expense of Florida’s taxpayers.  Related: Ron DeSantis thanks then attacks heckler who called him a fascist  In recent years, DeSantis’s ultra-conservative legislative agenda has drawn ire from a slew of marginalized communities as well as major corporations including Disney. The so-called “don’t say gay” bill, abortion bans and prohibition of African American studies are just a few of many DeSantis’s extremist policies that have been met with costly lawsuits in a state where residents are already struggling with costs of living.  “The list of legal challenges precipitating from DeSantis’s unconstitutional laws is endless,” the Democratic state senator Lori Berman said.  “We’ve seen Floridians rightly sue many if not all of the governor’s legislative priorities, including laws that restrict drag shows for kids, prohibit Chinese citizens from owning homes and land in Florida, suppress young and Black and brown voters, ban gender-affirming care and threaten supportive parents with state custody of their children, and of course, all the retaliatory legislation waged against Disney for coming out in support of the LGBTQ+ community,” she said.  As a result of the mounting lawsuits against DeSantis, the governor’s legal costs, which the Miami Herald reported last December to cost at least $16.7m, have been soaring.  In DeSantis’s legal fight against Disney following the corporation’s condemnation of his anti-LGBTQ+ laws, it is going to cost the governor and his handpicked board nearly $1,300 per hour in legal fees as they look into how the corporation discovered a loophole in DeSantis’s plan to acquire governing rights over Disney World, Insider reports.  “Disney is a perfect example. It doesn’t hurt any Floridians. There is nothing. It’s creating a legal issue out of nowhere and now Disney sued so they have to respond and that is going to cost taxpayers’ money. The whole Disney case is just because of DeSantis’s ego and his hurt feelings,” the Democratic state senator Tina Polsky said.  “Taxpayers are paying to foot the bills to pass unconstitutional bills and to keep up with his petty vengeance,” she said, adding, “I don’t think they’re aware at all … They’re too brainwashed at this point that they wouldn’t even care.”  Meanwhile, in another case covered by the Orlando Sentinel, DeSantis’s administration has turned to the elite conservative Washington DC-based law firm Cooper & Kirk to defend the governor against his slew of anti-woke laws. The firm’s lawyers charge $725 hourly, according to contracts reviewed by Orlando Sentinel. As of June 2022, the state authorized nearly $2.8m for legal services from just Cooper & Kirk alone, the outlet reports.  With mounting taxpayer-funded legal costs against DeSantis’s legislative agenda, critics ranging from civil rights organizations to the state’s Democratic lawmakers have lambasted DeSantis’s policies as unconstitutional and mere political stunts designed to propel him to the frontlines of the GOP primary.  “DeSantis went to Harvard for his [law degree]. This is someone who should understand the constraints placed on him and the state by the United States constitution and the Florida constitution. He knows those constraints, but he doesn’t care. His goal is to intentionally pass unconstitutional laws and set up legal challenges in order for the conservative supreme court to overturn long held protections,” Berman said.  Bob Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, echoed similar sentiments, comparing DeSantis to his main competition and current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, both of whom he said are cut “from the same cloth”.  Related: Ron DeSantis says he will ‘destroy leftism’ in US if elected president  “Ron DeSantis is a Harvard law school graduate. He is a lawyer. Whereas Donald Trump at least could make the argument, ‘I’m just the layperson, I don’t know’ if … something is deemed illegal or unconstitutional … DeSantis does not have that defense,” Jarvis said.  Nevertheless, DeSantis appears unfazed.  “DeSantis knows very well that … what he is doing is unconstitutional and illegal … Lawyers by training are very cautious so this is quite remarkable to have a lawyer-politician who not only knows better, but does not care,” said Jarvis.  To DeSantis, it does not matter whether he wins or loses the legal battles as he knows he “ultimately controls the Florida supreme court”, according to Jarvis.  “He is playing a ‘heads, I win, tails, you lose’ game. If he gets one of these crazy policies passed and they’re challenged and the court upholds him … he can say to the press and to the public, ‘I was right and the proof is in the pudding because the courts agreed with me,’” he explained.  “But even better for DeSantis when they rule against him … DeSantis is able to stand up and say, ‘These crazy judges want our children to watch drag shows, they want our children to be taught to be gay, they want Disney to be this terrible company. That’s why you need a strong governor and why you will benefit from having me as president because I will make sure to get rid of these judges and replace them with judges that have traditional American morals,’” Jarvis added.  As DeSantis continues to fight his costly legal battles, the state’s supermajority Republican legislature appears to encourage him wholly.  “We’re in a litigious society,” the state senate president, Kathleen Passidomo, told the Tallahassee Democrat while the senate budget chair, Doug Broxson, told the outlet: “We want the governor to be in a comfortable position to speak his mind.”  With Republicans rushing to DeSantis’s defense, perhaps the most glaring example of the legislature’s endorsement of his legal wars is the $16m incorporated into the state’s $117bn budget to be used exclusively for his litigation expenses.  Speaking to the Guardian, the state’s Democratic house leader, Fentrice Driskell, called the budget a “carte blanche” from Republicans and the result of zero accountability.  Related: DeSantis’s limp start to 2024 race delights Trump but battle is not over  “The legislature is supposed to be a check on executive power. By giving him a carte blanche to go and fight these wars in court, it’s basically just saying that there are no checks and balances when it comes to the state government in Florida,” said Driskell.  “It’s a waste … They are just allowing this single person to impose his will on the state of Florida and they’re willing to waste taxpayer dollars to do it,” she said, adding, “Most Floridians can’t afford their rent and property insurance rates are through the roof. We could have redirected that money towards affordable housing.”  Driskell went on to describe Medicaid iBudget Florida, a waiver that provides disabled Floridians with access to certain services and which currently has a waitlist of over 22,000 residents.  “It’s very difficult for them to get off that waitlist because the Republicans underfund Medicaid. We could put that money towards funding the waitlist and getting people off of it. I think there’s only $2m that was put in the budget for that this year. If we added the $16m that was added for these culture wars, my goodness, that’s $18m. Presumably we could help get nine times more people off of the waitlist,” said Driskell.  As DeSantis remains embroiled in his legal woes at the expense of Floridian taxpayers, there is perhaps a single group of people that have benefited the most out of all the legal drama, Jarvis told the Guardian.  “The lawyers who got that $16.7m, that’s money from heaven. That’s money that fell into their laps … Anytime there’s a loser, and the loser here is the Florida taxpayer, there is a winner. The winners here are the lawyers who are collecting those enormous fees. The more that plaintiffs file lawsuits and the more they fight these crazy policies, you know that’s just money in the bank for these lawyers,” he said.  “DeSantis has been God’s gift to lawyers,” he added.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has been embroiled in costly legal battles due to his ultra-conservative legislative agenda. \nTaxpayers are footing the bill for DeSantis' legal fees, which have been soaring since he took office in 2019. \nDeSantis' legal battles have been met with criticism from civil rights organizations and Democratic lawmakers. \nLawyers have been the biggest beneficiaries of DeSantis' legal wars, collecting enormous fees.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nRon DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has been facing numerous lawsuits from various communities whose rights have been violated due to his ultra-conservative legislative agenda.\nAs a result, the mounting legal costs have been heavily at the expense of Florida’s taxpayers.\nDeSantis has been using an elite conservative law firm to defend himself, and the state’s supermajority Republican legislature has incorporated $16 million into the state’s budget to be used exclusively for his litigation expenses.\nCritics have lambasted DeSantis’s policies as unconstitutional and mere political stunts, while lawyers have benefited from the legal drama."

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  Freshly inaugurated Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson says Chicago is a welcoming place for illegal immigrants, but he also says that helping illegal immigrants reach his sanctuary city is cruel and evil.  Chicago is a sanctuary city, which is why Texas has been busing illegal immigrants to it while trying to relieve the strain on smaller border towns. But Johnson finds this despicable, claiming, “It’s wicked. It’s unconscionable. But as you all know, the city of Chicago is coming together to make sure that people who wish to find real comfort here in the city of Chicago, that we provide that.”  THE ALARMING LINK BETWEEN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND MARIJUANA  Here is what Johnson’s campaign website said about immigration and Chicago’s sanctuary city status: “Chicago must lead with and live by the promise to be a sanctuary city and welcome immigrants and refugees, and treat them with dignity and respect. This sanctuary promise must extend to everyone who needs it in our city, and residents both old and new.”  How are these two quotes not contradictory? Why would it be “wicked” to help illegal immigrants travel to a city that promises to “treat them with dignity and respect”? Why would it be “unconscionable” to help illegal immigrants reach a city that extends its “sanctuary promise” to “everyone who needs it,” including “residents both old and new”? In this case, is Texas not doing those illegal immigrants a favor by sending them to such an accepting sanctuary city, free of charge?  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  In reality, this is Johnson trying to do the same dance that New York City and Washington, D.C., have been doing. He has to continue to posture that this is no big deal, even though outgoing mayor Lori Lightfoot already declared that Chicago “reached a breaking point” with illegal immigrant arrivals. He wants to try and shame Texas into stopping the practice because he can’t admit that his “sanctuary promise must extend to everyone who needs it” was a performative sham.  Johnson already telegraphed that he would be completely out of his depth when he said that violent rioters assaulting people in the streets were just being “silly” like middle school children. He is nothing more than the personification of shallow progressive talking points, and he already can’t get those points in concert with illegal immigration and his “sanctuary promise.”  Tags: Beltway Confidential, Opinion, Chicago, Brandon Johnson, Sanctuary Cities, illegal immigrants  Original Author: Zachary Faria  Original Location: Brandon Johnson thinks it is 'wicked' to help illegal immigrants reach his sanctuary city<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has declared Chicago a sanctuary city, but finds it \"wicked\" and \"unconscionable\" to help illegal immigrants reach it. \nJohnson's campaign website promises to treat immigrants and refugees with \"dignity and respect,\" but he is trying to shame Texas for sending illegal immigrants to Chicago.\nJohnson has already shown he is out of his depth, calling violent rioters \"silly\" like middle school children.\nJohnson's contradictory statements suggest his \"sanctuary promise\" may be performative.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nChicago's newly inaugurated mayor, Brandon Johnson, has declared the city a sanctuary city, but has also denounced Texas' practice of busing illegal immigrants to the city as \"wicked\" and \"unconscionable\".\nJohnson's campaign website promises to treat immigrants and refugees with dignity and respect, but his words and actions seem to be contradictory.\nHe is trying to shame Texas into stopping the practice, but is unable to admit that his \"sanctuary promise\" was a performative sham.\nJohnson's shallow progressive talking points are unable to reconcile his stance on illegal immigration and his \"sanctuary promise\"."

        "text": "As part of his crusade over government “weaponization,” Rep. Jim Jordan hasn’t had the best of luck. It was just a couple of months ago, for example, when the Ohio Republican pointed to FBI “whistleblowers” who weren’t actually whistleblowers, and who’d given behind-the-scenes testimony that was literally unbelievable.  This week, the far-right congressman’s troubles got noticeably worse. The New York Times reported overnight:  And what, pray tell, does this have to do with Jordan? As it turns out, the House Judiciary Committee’s panel on government “weaponization” is holding a hearing this morning, and members are hearing from two FBI agents: Marcus Allen and Stephen Friend.  Both Allen and Friend are two of the agents whose security clearances were revoked in response to alleged misconduct. According to the Times’ account, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, they’ve also been suspended by the bureau as the FBI reviews their cases.  A third agent, Brett Gloss, received the same punishment after the FBI determined that he broke the law by entering a restricted area of the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 while moving with the pro-Trump mob. Investigators concluded that Gloss provided “false and/or misleading information” about what he saw the day of the insurrectionist attack.  As for Jordan’s witnesses, Allen was found to have had “expressed sympathy for persons or organizations that advocate, threaten or use force or violence,” promoted conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 violence, and misled a colleague about a Jan. 6 suspect.  Friend, meanwhile, was apparently punished after refusing to participate in the arrest of a Jan. 6 suspect. According to a Washington Post report, bureau investigators also concluded that Friend “presented a number of security concerns related to his personal conduct, handling of protected information and ‘use of information technology.’”  When Jordan talks about his allied “whistleblowers” from within the FBI, who are eager to bolster his conspiracy theories about government agencies mistreating poor conservative victims, these are some of the folks he’s referring to.  As for the fact at least some of his alleged “whistleblowers” have also received financial support from a top Trump ally, the beleaguered committee chairman insisted this morning that this shouldn’t undermine their credibility.  No, of course not. Heaven forbid.  A Politico report last month quoted a GOP aide who conceded that on Capitol Hill, Republicans agree that Jordan’s “weaponization” panel was off to a “rocky start.”  As these latest developments help prove, the hapless partisan crusade is not improving. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nRep.

        "text": "This is an edited version of a speech former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivered Tuesday at the Austrian World Summit.  People ask me why I’m always smiling at environmental events. When I look back at the past 20 years and see how far we’ve come in California, how could I not smile?  A few weeks ago, I plugged in a huge solar roof on a 180,000 square foot warehouse at the port in Los Angeles. It was made possible by California's million solar roofs initiative. While I was there, I visited the startups inside that warehouse and saw the future: robots, clean cement, sustainable seafood, and companies making power from algae and waves.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  I can't stop myself from smiling when I see all of the progress toward a green future. And I have to laugh, because 20 years ago, when I ran for governor, environmentalists didn’t really buy in when I said I’d be a green governor. “The conservative who drives Hummers and blows up everything in his movies? Give us a break. Just another empty campaign promise.”  I wasn’t offended by it. I understood it. I was a newcomer. I was an outsider. I knew that my administration would have to do the work to prove the naysayers wrong, and over the next seven years, that’s exactly what we did. A million solar roofs. Our historic plan to reduce pollution by 25%. Stronger tailpipe emissions standards. A renewable portfolio standard to replace coal and gas with wind and solar.  As we accomplished all of that and more, environmentalists stopped looking at me with suspicion and started hugging me, using my movie lines and inviting me to speak at clean energy summits all over the world about the California model. There is an important lesson here. I want you to remember to keep the doors of our environmental movement open to the newcomers, the outsiders and the newly converted.  Focus on health dangers of air pollution  Outsiders always bring a fresh set of eyes to our mission. When I got involved, one of the first things I saw was that our marketing wasn’t working. We were talking about climate change when we should have been talking about pollution and the 7 million people who die every year choking on air poisoned by fossil fuels.  Are you allergies worse this spring? You can blame climate change.  Clean energy renaissance: Biden's State of the Union address confirms America's in a clean energy boom  I still feel like a newcomer today. I still see everything with fresh eyes.  Today, when I look at our environmental movement with those fresh eyes, I see a dire need. We need a new environmentalism based on building and growing and common sense. Old environmentalism was afraid of growth. It hated building. Many of you know this style − protesting every new development, chaining yourself to construction equipment, and using lawsuits and permitting to slow everything down.  © PATRICK T. FALLON, AFP via Getty Images US-Austrian actor and Former Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks about clean energy during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on January 4, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  I have to be honest: I don’t blame the old environmentalists. Back then, growth meant more fossil fuels, more pollution, more death. But times have changed, and we have to change with them.  Trust me, you don’t want to be the old, out-of-touch boomer asking for someone’s beeper number or looking for a VCR to watch movies.  Failure is possible if environmental movement doesn't change  It’s time for our environmental movement to wake up to the new reality and to change and adapt. Growth doesn’t have to be powered by fossil fuels any longer. Solar and wind now cost less than coal power. New electric car models are coming out regularly. Our progress is moving so quickly that it is hard to imagine how we could ever fail. But I want to be clear: we can fail, and if we do, it won’t be a failure of innovation.  It will be a failure of not growing and adapting with the times, not listening to the people, and not using the tools at our disposal.  It will be a failure to build. We can no longer allow red tape to hold our green revolution back.  We can no longer accept years of environmental review, thousand-page reports, and lawsuit after lawsuit keeping us from building. I want to be clear: I’m not just talking about building new highways or infrastructure. I’m talking about environmental projects!  Throughout the United States and Europe, thousands of clean energy projects sit waiting to be built. Delayed by bureaucracy. Delayed by permits. Delayed by old transmission lines. Delayed, delayed, delayed. In Europe, solar projects face wait times of up to four years. Wind projects can take up to 10 years.  Germany just hosted an environmental summit where they called for a deadline to end the fossil fuel age. At the same time, they closed their nuclear plants to replace them with gas, and dismantled a wind farm to make room for more coal.  Is this a joke? In the United States, we have more than 2,000 gigawatts of almost completely clean energy projects waiting in line. Just to give you an idea of how much power that is, the entire current United States electric grid capacity is 1,250 gigawatts.  We all agree that we are facing an emergency. Let me ask you a question: if you went to the hospital for a heart attack, and they told you they might save you after waiting a few days, what would you say? I know none of you would put up with it.  So why are we putting up with these delays in our pollution emergency?  Opinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

Recent reforms from the European Union to fast track many of these projects give me great hope. I am proud of all of you, and I hope that my American friends are paying attention.  President Biden: I’m doing everything I can to reduce gun violence, but Congress must do more  Michael J Fox: Do you have Parkinson's? New test is 'breakthrough' in diagnosing disease.  The White House and Congress are now talking about reform. Good. Keep talking. Get it done. Don't let perfect be the enemy of progress. All over the world, we have to keep reforming the system to work faster. We have to stay on top of this. People are dying.  That’s why, today, I call on every government around the world to clear the path for green projects, start the building and terminate pollution.  I call on my environmentalist friends to move past the old ways and to embrace a new environmentalism based on clean energy growth.  I call for change. Change is never easy, but this is an emergency, and this emergency demands action.  Lives depend on it.  One of California’s most famous companies, Facebook, had an equally famous motto: Move fast and break things. Let the slogan for our new environmentalism be: Move fast and build things. Build a clean and abundant energy future.  Build better. Build cleaner. Build now. Build, build, build. We can do it. We have the power.

        "text": "It’s Henry Kissinger’s 100th birthday today. The fact that this monster is celebrated instead of in jail tells you that he’s part of a much bigger problem — and that problem is America’s global empire.  © Provided by Jacobin The ugliest truth about Henry Kissinger is that he isn’t a unique monster. (Adam Berry / Getty Images)  The late Anthony Bourdain wrote in 2001 that “once you’ve been to Cambodia, you’ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands.”  However many people might have wanted to do that over the decades, Kissinger remains with us. Today is his one hundredth birthday. And he continues to be treated as a respected elder statesman. That should tell you everything you need to know about America’s global empire.  At Least He Likes Sports  Tributes have been flowing to Dr Kissinger all week. At CNN, foreign correspondent David Andelman enthuses that “at 100, Henry Kissinger is still teaching us the value of ‘Weltanschaüng.’” (Weltanschaüng roughly translates to “worldview,” and here it means something like “a comprehensive understanding of how the world works.”) On the website of the International Olympic Committee, IOC president Thomas Bach calls Kissinger a “great statesman” and “political genius” who is also a “great sports enthusiast” and has long been involved with the Olympics.  None cared to mention his various crimes.  As Richard Nixon’s national security advisor — and then secretary of state, a role he took on without giving up his original job — Kissinger personally oversaw a bombing campaign that killed 150,000 civilians in Cambodia. And among many other atrocities he abetted, he helped overthrow Salvador Allende, the democratically elected socialist president of Chile. Kissinger notoriously said that he didn’t see “why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people.”  The evidence for these crimes has never been in doubt. It’s all a matter of public record. So why hasn’t “Dr K” ever seen the inside of a jail cell?  The ugliest truth about Kissinger is that he isn’t a unique monster. He is an unusually plainspoken representative of a monstrous system of US global hegemony.  Kissinger and Nixon  Nixon didn’t live to see his own hundredth birthday. He died at the age of eighty-one in 1994. But a posthumous centennial birthday celebration was held for the disgraced former president in 2013. Kissinger spoke at that event, ending his remarks by proposing a toast to Nixon as a “patriot, president, and, above all, peacemaker.”  It’s true that Nixon was willing to pursue pragmatic détentes with America’s superpower rivals, China and the Soviet Union. But when I watched the clip of Kissinger’s “peacemaker” toast, all I could think about was an infamous snippet from the 1970 conversation between Kissinger and his deputy Alexander Haig in which Kissinger relays Nixon’s instructions for the bombing of Cambodia. Kissinger knew some members of the administration might have qualms about extending the war to a neutral country, but he made it clear that the commander in chief didn’t want to hear it.  K: Two, he wants a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. He doesn’t want to hear anything. It’s an order, it’s to be done. Anything that flies on anything that moves. You got that? H: (Couldn’t hear but sounded like Haig laughing.)  A few years later, Nixon and Kissinger would burnish their “peacemaker” credentials by finally throwing in the towel after several years of ratcheting up bloodshed in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Perhaps this is the achievement Kissinger was fondly remembering when he toasted his old boss’s memory.  If so, Kissinger was conveniently forgetting that he and Nixon had been spurning essentially the same deal the whole time they’d been escalating the war. In fact, even before Nixon arrived at the White House, he’d worked to sabotage his predecessor Lyndon Johnson’s Paris peace talks — encouraging the South Vietnamese delegation to stonewall in the hopes of getting a better deal when Nixon assumed office.  That much no one bothers to deny. There is some controversy about the extent of Dr Kissinger’s role. In his CNN tribute, David Andelman defends Kissinger by arguing that while “some have suggested that it was Kissinger who sought to slow the process toward peace during Nixon’s presidential campaign,” the evidence from the White House tapes points to H. R. Haldeman as Nixon’s primary accomplice in “monkey wrenching” the talks. But even Adelman allows that Dr Kissinger “may well have tipped off Nixon’s campaign team to Johnson’s thinking.”  A small point, maybe, to hold against an Important Statesman who throws around words like Weltanschaüng.  A Story of Continuity  When Congress brought articles of impeachment against Nixon for corruption and obstruction of justice, Michigan Democratic representative John Conyers proposed including an article on the illegal bombing of Cambodia — which had initially been kept secret from the US public. The proposal was defeated 26 to 12. As Conyers reflected in an article later that year, this may have been because raising the issue of war crimes in Southeast Asia would have impugned “previous administrations” and Congress’s own failure to constrain presidential war-making power.  When Nixon left office, Kissinger stayed on, continuing to serve his highly unusual dual role as national security advisor and secretary of state for Nixon’s successor Gerald Ford. And every single president between Ford and Joe Biden — Democrats and Republican alike — has at some point extended an invitation to Dr K to come to the White House to discuss matters of war and diplomacy.  Some of those visits may have even afforded Kissinger a chance to catch up with old friends. That ghoul softly laughing on the other end of the line as Kissinger relayed Nixon’s instructions for the indiscriminate mass murder of Cambodian civilians, Alexander Haig? He served as commander of US European Command and NATO supreme allied commander for most of Jimmy Carter’s presidency. Ronald Reagan made him secretary of state.  Kissinger Isn’t the Only Kissinger  Oddly, Kissinger hasn’t been to the Biden White House, or at least not yet. I’d like to believe that the current president is disturbed by Kissinger’s long history of involvement in prosecutable crimes against humanity. But Biden’s history suggests otherwise.  Does it bother Biden that Kissinger killed lots of civilians in Cambodia? Senator Biden showed no such qualms about the “shock and awe” bombing of Iraq when he backed that war in 2003.  Does it bother Biden that Kissinger plotted coups against elected leftists in Latin America? Vice President Biden doesn’t seem to have uttered a peep of protest when President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hilary Clinton supported the coup against Honduran president Manuel Zelaya.  And while we’re on the subject of Hilary Clinton, it’s worth remembering that she touted her relationship with Henry Kissinger — whom she called a friend and trusted advisor — when she was running for president in 2016. When her primary challenger Bernie Sanders responded by bringing up Salvador Allende, the response from both Clinton and the moderator might as well have been, “Salvador who?”  Kissinger has never deigned to conceal his complicity in clear violations of US and international law that killed vast numbers of innocent people. The fact that he’s reached the age of one hundred as a free man isn’t an oversight; it’s a symptom of a much deeper pathology.  A willingness to bend the global rules — order an assassination here, massacre some villagers there, depose an elected leftist or two in countries that, come on, don’t really matter anyway — was integral to how the United States managed its spheres of influence around the world long before Henry Kissinger came on the scene.  It’s not like Dwight Eisenhower needed advice from Henry Kissinger, who was just about finishing up graduate school at the time, when he decided to protect the interests of the United Fruit Company by overthrowing the government of Guatemala in 1954. And Secretary Clinton may or may not have picked up a phone to consult with a very elderly Dr K about how to handle the crisis in Honduras.  I certainly won’t shed any tears when Dr Kissinger finally dies. And I’ll be ecstatic — if shocked — if he sees the inside of a courtroom before that happens. But we shouldn’t fool ourselves into thinking that he’s unique. You don’t run a globe-spanning empire for this many decades, batting down geopolitical rivals, peasant revolutions, insurgencies in occupied countries, and inconvenient electorates in crucial client states, without a lot of people staffing your imperial apparatus who think like Henry Kissinger.  There may be something almost demonic in how unabashed Dr K is about his crimes. But when it comes to his basic willingness to disregard legal and moral obstacles to the United States working its will in the world?  It’s Kissingers all the way down.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThis article examines the legacy of Henry Kissinger, who is celebrating his 100th birthday today.\nIt looks at his involvement in various war crimes, such as the bombing of Cambodia, and his role in overthrowing the democratically elected socialist president of Chile.\nIt argues that Kissinger is not a unique monster, but rather a representative of a monstrous system of US global hegemony.\nThe article also looks at how Kissinger has been treated as a respected elder statesman, despite his crimes, and how other US presidents have invited him to the White House to discuss matters of war and diplomacy.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nHenry Kissinger is celebrated instead of in jail, which reveals the reality of America's global empire. \nKissinger was involved in bombing campaigns that killed 150,000 civilians in Cambodia and helped overthrow the democratically elected socialist president of Chile. \nKissinger has been invited to the White House by every president since Gerald Ford, and his crimes have never been in doubt. \nKissinger is not a unique monster, but a representative of a monstrous system of US global hegemony."

        "text": "President Ronald Reagan strode to the White House podium on April 26, 1983, to frame the education reform agenda that would galvanize bipartisan support for the next 40 years. The commission report he released, \"A Nation at Risk,\" asserted that higher standards, more standardized tests and tougher school accountability were needed to protect America’s economic and military security. © Brittany Hosea-Small, For USA TODAY For public education to play its part in redeeming the promise of America, we must preserve the strengths of education reform while recommitting to a broader vision of education that prepares young people for citizenship, work and living healthy lives. This simple construction successfully generated a sense of urgency around improving public education among leaders across the nation and on both sides of the political aisle. Forty years later, however, we are even more a nation at risk, with waning commitment to democracy, unsustainable income inequality, and an epidemic of anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts among adolescents.

Class of 2023, get out and vote' Mental health: So you have a college graduate, now what? Why a plan forging forward is imperative. For public education to play its part in redeeming the promise of America, we must preserve the strengths of education reform while recommitting to a broader vision of education that prepares young people for citizenship, work and living healthy lives. The education reform movement that Reagan helped to launch four decades ago activated a powerful coalition, including business leaders who needed better-educated workers and civil rights leaders who saw higher expectations as a path to greater investments in disadvantaged communities. Southern governors from both parties were early adopters with an eye on economic development, rallying around standards-based reform to assert state leadership over the local control of public schools. Education reform delivered better student achievement, but we need new approach now The resulting reforms delivered important wins: Student achievement went up, especially in the early years and especially among the lowest-performing students, narrowing racial achievement gaps. High school graduation rates improved as better data brought new attention and investment. Perhaps most important, the focus on outcomes and the advent of disaggregated data to account for performance among different groups created infrastructure for improvement that we must never abandon. What really stuck was the urgency to improve reading and math achievement and test-based accountability as the primary strategy. This laser-like focus drove resources to very real problems but, over time, the emphasis on test scores became the raison d’etre of education itself, displacing foundational purposes such as getting ready for citizenship and learning practical life skills. This approach has not delivered on its own terms: test scores stagnated for a decade, even before the pandemic. Moreover, fundamentals such as social studies and science, not to mention art, were diminished to make room for longer reading and math blocks. Jeb Bush: In this city, 93% of students are failing math I'm a foster kid with a degree: That shouldn't be rare, but it is. We can change that. Too much emphasis is placed on reading and math scores That turned out to be counterproductive. More time on social studies and art increases reading scores and other positive outcomes, while science is fundamental to sustainability and many meaningful careers. The education reforms that sprung from \"A Nation at Risk\"also privileged external, credentialed expertise and randomized control trials over the wisdom of experience and cultural responsiveness, ultimately alienating many schools from the communities they exist to serve. That increased disconnect has been especially acute in schools serving predominantly low-income students and students of color.

Students need to feel connected, challenged and supported at school. Social-emotional learning (SEL), fundamental to healthy human development, has been relegated to secondary status even though student surveys reporting their sense of social belonging and motivation to work hard at school are much better predictors of graduating high school and going to college than test score gains. According to Populace, parents’ top priorities for school are developing practical life skills, sharpening critical thinking and problem solving, and ensuring students demonstrate character traits such as honesty, kindness and integrity. These attributes are foundational to living a fulfilling life, succeeding in the future of work and being a good citizen. At this point, prioritizing standardized test scores as the most important measure of high-quality education ignores evidence that other measures are more important to parents and better predictors of long-term success.

Their mental health depends on it. Americans will confront existential risks in the years ahead: artificial intelligence and automation accelerating disruption in the labor market; misinformation and deep fakes coursing through social media and subverting truth; climate change that threatens our existence, just to name a few. Reading and math are, of course, important, but we can’t rely on test scores in these two subjects to orient the whole educational enterprise.

        "text": "Kevin McCarthy faces a clear challenge as he tries to strike a debt limit deal: Any compromise he makes with President Joe Biden risks sparking a conservative rebellion aimed at ending his speakership. But some Democrats have a plan to spare him. A small group of moderate Democratic lawmakers has quietly reassured its House GOP counterparts that it can help protect McCarthy’s gavel if his right flank revolts over a debt agreement, according to two people familiar with the discussions. If conservatives responded to a McCarthy-Biden deal by forcing a full House vote on ousting the California Republican, Democrats say they have enough members to help block it — keeping him in power. “We’ll protect him if he does the right thing,” said one of the House Democrats involved in the talks, who requested anonymity because of the ongoing debt negotiations. That Democrat added that McCarthy himself has been briefed on the discussions. It’s a polarizing strategy for those centrists to entertain in private with other Democrats, let alone admit to planning to deploy. And senior republicans dismiss likelihood the gambit would come to pass. That’s because it’s not clear that conservatives would try to depose the speaker even if he edges away from the position he’s staked out on the debt limit — and should they try to, Republicans from McCarthy’s camp on down insist there can be no Democratic bailout. “The Speaker has never heard of this garbage, has zero interest in it, and thinks Democrats would be better off focusing on doing the jobs they were elected to do,” McCarthy spokesperson Mark Bednar said in a statement. When some Democrats floated a similar offer to then-Speaker John Boehner in 2013 during a similar fiscal fight within the GOP, he later decided to resign rather than lean on his opponents to keep the gavel. However, it’s potential insurance for McCarthy — and a sign of the growing sense of desperation on the Hill — as the White House and congressional leaders race toward a deal to avert an economy-rattling debt crisis in the coming weeks. Those who revealed the conversations on condition of anonymity declined to name who’s leading them, but chatter about the protect-McCarthy idea is growing across the Democratic caucus. And it’s perhaps loudest in the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. Democrats in the Problem Solvers, which has a reputation for attempting to back-channel during high-level talks, are specifically looking to counterbalance the influence of the roughly 40 ultraconservative Republicans in the Freedom Caucus with their own members. The group includes 32 Democrats; not all of them are involved in the talks about backing McCarthy on a so-called “motion to vacate” the speakership, but their numbers are nearly enough to neuter the threat from the right. Members of the Problem Solvers have privately discussed the idea for months, though conversations have become less theoretical as debt talks advanced in recent days, according to both people involved in the conversations. Even outside of that moderate group, however, senior Democrats are also floating the protect-McCarthy idea — even raising it to party leaders, according to three other people familiar with those conversations. And they said some Democrats have suggested to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries that he use it as leverage over the speaker in the debt negotiations. Jeffries insisted that any game-planning for a potential GOP move to topple McCarthy should play no part in the debt debate. “No, I don’t think that the two are connected at all,” he said in a brief interview. And Republicans are already rejecting the notion of a Democratic salvage mission for McCarthy should he and Biden ink a pact that alienates conservatives. “We’re not talking about all that stuff. … Republicans remain united. We’re not going to negotiate against ourselves,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said. But behind the scenes, a growing number of rank-and-file Democrats are speculating about how to defuse possible conservative backlash to a possible deal as they’ve begun to map out a coalition to pass a debt agreement, should Biden and McCarthy reach one. The path to 218 votes in the House even emerged as the main topic of a special Democratic meeting last week, when Jeffries and his leadership team met with other senior members from all corners of the caucus to discuss the debt crisis, according to two people close to the discussions. “What I’ve said over and over in the last few days is that the votes for this are going to come from the middle, … which then raises the obvious question, the motion to vacate,” said Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.), who chairs the centrist New Democrat Coalition. Kuster recommended a party conversation over how to handle the possibility. If Democrats help the right vent its fury by yanking McCarthy’s gavel, she added, “Then what? You get [Majority Leader Steve] Scalise. The politics don’t really change.” Like Kuster, other Democrats said they weren’t ruling out aiding McCarthy to protect a future deal. © J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo “What I’ve said over and over in the last few days is that the votes for this are going to come from the middle,” Rep. Annie Kuster said about a debt agreement. “I would vote to do what’s best for this country and I’ll leave it at that,” Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) said. “That’s a question that should be on a philosophy exam. And the answer is, I don’t know. Depends on the circumstances,” said swing-seat Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.). As talks between top Republicans and Democrats drag closer to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s early-June projected deadline, some lawmakers have also begun to plan for what happens if the two sides can’t reach a deal. If that happens, Democrats say they’d likely try to force their own debt solution to the floor using a procedural escape valve of sorts that’s known as a discharge petition. It’s highly unlikely that they could enlist enough GOP backers to get to a majority of the House, unlocking the full potential of that tool, but Democratic leaders can start mobilizing for signatures for that move as soon as Wednesday. Whether they’ll do so depends on the outcome of Tuesday’s White House meeting, according to two separate people familiar with the conversations. So for the moment, Democrats are left with few obvious maneuvers to block and tackle for a debt deal aside from their bid to protect the speaker. If a member of McCarthy’s own party did trigger a vote of no confidence, Democrats wouldn’t even need to vote for the California Republican himself — instead, they’d just need to block it from coming up. Some Democrats are openly disinterested in the prospect. “That’s so far down the line right now, in terms of what might actually happen. At the end of the day, the solution is probably going to come from the Senate when we get really close to defaulting,” Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said. Still, she added of McCarthy: “I’m not sure who else could run that conference.” And Democratic centrists who want to signal they’d back McCarthy, if he agrees to a debt plan they agree with, insisted there would be enough votes on their side to help the speaker stay in power. “If he showed some courage to bring something to the floor that would result in a motion to vacate, we would be there to keep him in the seat,” said a second centrist involved in the internal discussions. Even so, that Democrat acknowledged that a speaker propped up with the votes of his opponents would be committing “a slower suicide.” “I don’t think McCarthy’s the kind of guy who wants this to be his kind of legacy.” Jordain Carney contributed to this report.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nA small group of moderate Democratic lawmakers has offered to protect Kevin McCarthy's speakership if his right flank revolts over a debt agreement. \nDemocrats have enough members to block a motion to vacate the speakership, should conservatives try to depose McCarthy. \nDemocrats are discussing the possibility of using a discharge petition to force their own debt solution to the floor. \nIf McCarthy agrees to a debt plan that Democrats agree with, they would be willing to back him and keep him in power.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe article discusses a plan by a small group of moderate Democratic lawmakers to protect House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's gavel if his right flank revolts over a debt agreement.\nThe plan involves the Democrats having enough members to block a motion to vacate the speakership should it arise.\nRepublicans have dismissed the likelihood of the plan coming to pass, and Democrats have also discussed forcing their own debt solution to the floor using a discharge petition.\nThe article also discusses the potential consequences of McCarthy agreeing to a debt plan that alienates conservatives."

        "text": "© Provided by LGBTQNation The pastor tweeted in support of Uganda's new \"Kill the Gays\" law.  The pastor who delivered the invocation at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis‘s (R) second inauguration has said that gay people should be put to death.  Tom Ascol — senior pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Cape Coral, Florida — made his comment on Twitter while criticizing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). On Monday, Cruz issued a tweet criticizing Uganda’s new “Anti-Homosexuality Act,” a law that punishes “aggravated homosexuality” with death.  Cruz’s tweet called the law “horrific & wrong,” adding, “Any law criminalizing homosexuality or imposing the death penalty for ‘aggravated homosexuality’ is grotesque & an abomination. ALL civilized nations should join together in condemning this human rights abuse.”  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  Ascol disagreed, writing on Tuesday, “Tell it to God, Ted.”  The pastor then cited Leviticus 20:13, the Old Testament verse that says, “If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.”  Ascol asked, “Was this law God gave to His old covenant people ‘horrific and wrong’?”  Leviticus’ ancient Biblical laws also require the death penalty for anyone who practices fortune telling, curses their mother or father, accidentally kills someone else’s animal, or commits blasphemy. Other Old Testament laws demand death for anyone who charges interest on loans or works on Saturdays.  Most contemporary Christians don’t follow these ancient Biblical laws and say that the crucifixion of Jesus Christ made them obsolete. However, conservative Christians tend to cite Leviticus 20:13 as proof that God shares their hatred of LGBTQ+ people.  Two hours later, Ascol tweeted, “Amazing how many professing Christians, even self-designated ‘conservative’ ones, are embarrassed by God’s Word. Just quote some unpopular words of God & watch what happens. Many so-called Christians react the same way that unashamed unbelievers do. It’s a commentary.”  DeSantis has signed numerous laws punishing teachers who mention LGBTQ+ issues, school officials who implement for trans-inclusive policies, doctors who provide gender-affirming care, transgender people who use bathrooms matching their gender identity, and businesses that allow children to see drag queens.  Ascol has previously said that women who have abortions should be imprisoned for murder. He also helped author The Dallas Statement, a 2018 statement that referred to same-sex attraction as a “sinful, disordered affection” and same-sex marriage as against “God’s design.” The statement rejected both “gay Christians” and the idea of gender fluidity. It also called “intersectionality, radical feminism, and critical race theory” inconsistent with “biblical teaching.”  U.S. evangelicals had a hand in creating Uganda’s law. The law has threatened the safety and well-being of LGBTQ+ Ugandans. Police and civilians have harassed any people they suspect of being gay. Some LGBTQ+ Ugandans have fled their home country, afraid for their lives. The law is supported by conservative pundits, including transphobic Matt Walsh, his colleague Michael Knowles, Heritage Foundation fellow Delano Squires, and New York Post columnist Miranda Devine.  Religious conservatives have also praised Russia for its laws punishing LGBTQ+ people. In 2013, Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute (C-FAM) President Austin Ruse said Russia’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws were a “good thing” that “most of the people in the United States” would support. In 2014, anti-LGBTQ+ evangelical leader Franklin Graham also defended the law.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the controversial comments made by Tom Ascol, the pastor who delivered the invocation at Florida Gov.\nRon DeSantis's second inauguration.\nAscol tweeted in support of Uganda's new \"Kill the Gays\" law, citing Leviticus 20:13 as proof that God shares their hatred of LGBTQ+ people.\nThe article also mentions how U.S. evangelicals had a hand in creating Uganda's law, and how religious conservatives have praised Russia for its laws punishing LGBTQ+ people.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nPastor Tom Ascol of Grace Baptist Church in Cape Coral, Florida, tweeted in support of Uganda's new \"Kill the Gays\" law.\nLeviticus 20:13 calls for the death penalty for homosexual acts.\nU.S. evangelicals had a hand in creating Uganda's law, which has threatened the safety and well-being of LGBTQ+ Ugandans.\nReligious conservatives have praised Russia for its laws punishing LGBTQ+ people."

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  As the various factions on Capitol Hill pore over the proposed debt ceiling deal, I cannot help but wonder at how much the conservative wing of the Republican Party has been able to accomplish in this process.  I know that sentiment isn’t shared by every conservative, and certainly not by every member of the Freedom Caucus. And I respect that. They are elected and I am not; they have constituents to worry about, and I stopped worrying about that long ago. They have to get elected again, whereas I just sit back, observe and comment.  But that detachment — viewing this deal as an informed citizen, and not someone with a voting card — does give me a different perspective. And from where I am sitting, we are witnessing a miracle — a minor miracle, perhaps, but a miracle just the same.  That’s because there will actually be some spending reductions as part of this deal. Not large reductions, by any measure. But some. There are some policy reforms as well — not a lot, but some. There is even some COVID money clawed back — not as much as some Republicans would have liked, but some.  It is hard to describe how countercultural that list truly is. After all, Washington really hates spending reductions. It loathes conservative policy changes. And it almost never, ever, claws back money it has already spent. To put that in perspective, there is still unspent money from Hurricane Katrina. Please allow that to sink in.  So, I will take “some” minor victories. “Some,” after all, is a lot better than what conservatives got the last couple of times the debt ceiling was raised. That includes increases, by the way, that took place with a Republican in the White House. And it even includes one increase when Republicans controlled the House, the Senate and the White House. That year, the deal that President Trump negotiated raised the debt ceiling and had precisely zero spending reductions. It was so awful that 90 House Republicans voted against it.  The fiscally conservative wing of the GOP lost some of its focus while Donald Trump was in the White House. That might be understandable: It’s sort of hard to be a fiscally conservative Republican when the head of your party is attacking you for wanting to spend less.  Trump even dissed fiscal conservatives as he cut a debt-ceiling deal with Nancy Pelosi, tweeting, “Republicans, sorry, but I’ve been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn’t happen!”  That fiasco cost them, for a time, the moral high ground when it comes to an issue on which Republicans should dominate.  If the current debt ceiling battle marks a return to the GOP’s fiscally conservative roots, it will be a welcome development. Indeed, later is better than never.  Back in 2017, left-leaning media outlets inside the Beltway were beside themselves, trumpeting headlines as to “How Democrats Rolled Trump on the Debt Ceiling.” And Democrats on Capitol Hill were trying hard not to gloat, lest the deal fall apart.  Republicans didn’t roll anyone here, and there certainly isn’t much to gloat about. But fiscal conservatives got something, which is more than anyone expected. That might not be enough for some Republicans to vote for the bill. But for us ordinary, fiscally conservative-minded citizens, it is a move in the right direction for a change.  Mick Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina, is a contributor to NewsNation. He served as director of the Office of Management and Budget, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and acting White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe proposed debt ceiling deal includes some spending reductions, policy reforms, and COVID money clawed back. \nThis is a minor miracle, as Washington usually does not reduce spending or claw back money. \nThe fiscally conservative wing of the GOP lost focus while Donald Trump was in the White House. \nThis deal marks a return to the GOP's fiscally conservative roots.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe article discusses the debt ceiling deal proposed by Capitol Hill and how it is a minor miracle for the conservative wing of the Republican Party.\nIt notes that the deal includes some spending reductions, policy reforms, and COVID money clawed back, which is countercultural for Washington.\nThe article also reflects on how the fiscally conservative wing of the GOP lost focus while Donald Trump was in the White House, but this deal marks a return to their roots.\nIt concludes that while it may not be enough for some Republicans to vote for the bill, it is a move in the right direction for fiscally conservative-minded citizens."

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  A spokesperson for Prince Harry says that he and his wife Meghan suffered a \"near catastrophic car chase\" in New York City on Tuesday evening. The spokesperson said that the chase was provoked by paparazzi who followed the couple and Meghan's mother without regard for traffic laws. The implication: Harry's party narrowly avoided the fate of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a 1997 Paris car crash as she was pursued by the paparazzi.  One problem with Harry's story?  The NYPD said that while the paparazzi behaved in a \"challenging\" manner last night, it has no record of a chase or any collisions. But here's another question: Why did a chase occur in the first place? Why did Harry's security team, which was either directly or indirectly operating under his authority, attempt to escape the paparazzi rather than maintain normal driving conditions?  KAMALA HARRIS TAKES HER PLACE AT THE DEBT LIMIT NEGOTIATING TABLE  Perhaps the paparazzi were occasionally blocking the couple's vehicle. Harry's spokesperson has suggested as much. But if that's the case, the appropriate response would have been for Harry's security team to call the NYPD. I understand that Harry's private security team is extremely well resourced and staffed by former police officers and close protection specialists. Those personnel likely had personal contacts with the NYPD via which they could expedite an effective NYPD response.  Again, the central question must be asked: Why did Harry allow a chase to occur?  Even if, as seems likely, the paparazzi were breaking traffic laws without regard to public safety, that does not mean Harry gets to do the same. On the contrary, vehicle-based close protection tactics suggest that where a lawful escape plan is impossible, or a threat is primarily that of nonviolent crowds (a la paparazzi), the appropriate response is to establish a static defensive position and wait for backup. That might not be preferable for Harry, but it is what the circumstances and the law would seemingly demand.  So, what's really going on here?  I suspect two things.  First, Harry likely seeks to use this incident to bolster his case for greater privacy against uncomfortable media attention. Harry and Meghan revel in positive media coverage and high-profile engagements such as that which they attended on Tuesday evening. At the same time, they demand protection from the less fun privileges granted to the public by the First Amendment. While Harry and Meghan are highly litigious in their approach to the U.K. media, they cannot apply that same strategy to the U.S. media by virtue of America's far freer speech laws, laws that Harry has described as \"bonkers.\"  Second, Harry may well hope that this incident will provide him with an excuse to have his U.S. government Diplomatic Security Service detail restored. That security detail was pulled by the Trump administration following criticism from some, myself included, that a nonactive U.K. royal was being provided an expensive U.S. government protection. The advantage for Harry, however, is that a DSS detail would allow him to move without the need to suffer paparazzi pursuit and pesky traffic laws. Regardless, the already greatly overstretched DSS does not have the resources to support a full-time detail for Harry. Evincing his preference for government-provided security, Harry has engaged in legal action with the U.K. government over its removal of his Metropolitan Police service protection team.

The 14th Amendment states, in the relevant part, “the validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, … shall not be questioned.”  Some people think the debt limit is unconstitutional because exceeding the limit would raise questions about the validity of the debt. But invoking an untested theory regarding the meaning of the 14th Amendment — after many decades in which Congress’s authority to impose a statutory debt limit has been accepted — would be a legal long-shot at best. It would certainly be challenged in court, resulting in uncertainty over the validity of any debt issued before the Supreme Court could decide the case.  However, without resorting to the 14th Amendment, there is a statutory debt limit “escape clause” that has gone unnoticed.  The debt limit applies to two categories of debt: debt held by the public and debt held by government trust funds. When the combined amount reaches the limit, the Treasury Department can temporarily redeem debt held by the trust funds and borrow an equal amount from the public without exceeding the limit. This exchange is one of several transactions, collectively referred to as “extraordinary measures,” that the Treasury is currently using to temporarily postpone a default.  The Treasury Department is authorized to redeem debt held by the Civil Service Retirement System and the federal employee’s Thrift Savings Plan. Trust fund programs like Social Security, Medicare and military retirement are not on the list of extraordinary measures. However, the Treasury secretary is not required to invest these trust funds when they are needed to meet current withdrawals. Thus, redeeming them to pay scheduled benefits is allowed.  How much trust fund debt could be redeemed? Assuming the Treasury Department had the ability to prioritize payments, it could redeem just enough to cover Social Security and other payments made from the trust funds. But if the Treasury cannot or will not prioritize some payments over others, to be sure all trust fund obligations are paid in full and on time and cleared through the banking system, the government would also need to ensure the Treasury general account is never overdrawn.  Consider this analogy: You deposit $2,000 in your checking account to pay the rent, but the bank clears a $200 check your spouse wrote for groceries first, so your rent check bounces. One way to avoid this result would be to redeem enough trust fund debt to cover all the government’s bills each month. In other words, deposit $2,200, rather than $2,000.  Given the current balance in all the trust funds ($5.9 trillion), the Treasury Department would be able to make trust fund payments — and fund the rest of the government as well — for a considerable period without increasing the debt limit.  As long as there is a positive balance in the trust funds, the Treasury secretary has both the authority and the obligation to make scheduled trust fund payments. Even though Congress intended to prohibit the use of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds to circumvent the debt limit in 1996, Congress also intended to allow the trust funds to be redeemed when necessary to meet current withdrawals.  If Congress and the White House fail to increase the debt limit before the traditional extraordinary measures have been exhausted, the Treasury secretary will be forced to choose between defaulting on legally binding trust fund obligations, as well as other obligations, or using the debt limit escape clause.

        "text": "© David Becker/Washington Post via Getty Images New York Representative-elect George Santos speaks during the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 19.  The biography of Congress member George Santos seemed quite impressive. The 34-year-old son of immigrants had graduated from Baruch College, a public college in New York, before going on to work at firms like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Santos eventually became a successful financier who started an animal rescue charity. The problem is that biography was apparently a lie, and now he is facing both political consequences and legal consequences for his wholesale inventions.  As revealed in the New York Times on December 19, it wasn’t just that Santos exaggerated his résumé — he allegedly invented it out of whole cloth. It set in motion a chain of events that culminated on Wednesday with Santos being indicted for wire fraud and money laundering in federal court on Long Island. Santos was accused of soliciting funds from donors to support his campaign and then converting them for his own personal use as well as claiming Covid-19 unemployment benefits while he had a full-time job making a six-figure salary. He pleaded not guilty to all 13 charges and was released on a $500,000 bond.  The sordid saga of Santos started when the Times found that he apparently did not graduate from Baruch College, he did not work for Goldman Sachs or Citigroup, there were no records of him being a successful financier, nor were there of him registering his animal rescue charity. The Times also found that he had been charged with check fraud in Brazil.  Further, a number of outlets have found no evidence of Santos’s repeated claims to be Jewish, to have Jewish heritage, or to be descended from refugees fleeing the Holocaust. Santos even described himself at one point as a “proud American Jew” in a campaign position paper.  In a media tour with friendly outlets on December 26, Santos admitted to putting “a little bit of fluff” on his résumé. In other words, he conceded that he never graduated from college, never worked for Goldman Sachs or Citigroup, and wasn’t Jewish (though he claimed to be “Jew-ish”). Santos brushed off lying about basic biographical information as embellishment, and he pushed back on the Times’s reporting about his criminal charge in Brazil. “I am not a criminal,” he told the New York Post. In May, however, he accepted a plea deal in a remote court hearing in Rio de Janeiro, where he admitted his guilt and agreed to pay roughly $2,000 in fines and $2,800 in restitution in exchange for having the charges dropped.  The whole Santos story has sparked one of the more bizarre political scandals in American history. Members of Congress have committed murder in office. In fact, a member of Congress has even killed another member of Congress. Even in the present day, we’ve seen every scandal under the sun, from Anthony Weiner tweeting a lewd picture of himself, to Marjorie Taylor Greene’s infamous Facebook post about Jewish space lasers. But it’s hard to think of a precedent for a scandal like this as Santos faces calls for his resignation from fellow Republicans and investigations into potential criminal misconduct.  Who is George Santos?  There are some things we know about Santos. The openly gay son of Brazilian immigrants, he was elected in November to an open congressional seat that includes a thin slice of Queens and much of the North Shore of Long Island in Nassau County. Santos defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent. This represented a major swing from 2020 when Biden had won the district by the same margin. That year, Santos ran against incumbent Tom Suozzi in a similar district and lost handily by a margin of 56 percent to 43.5 percent.  Santos is also an ardent Trump supporter — so much so that he was at Trump’s Ellipse rally on January 6, 2021, and has repeatedly falsely claimed that the former president won the 2020 election.  Also, for all his alleged lying about his résumé, it is clear that one company Santos worked at, Harbor City Capital, has been accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of being a Ponzi scheme. As for Santos’s other employment, he did spend a stint as a Portuguese language customer service agent for DISH Network a decade ago.  Santos has also been accused of setting up a GoFundMe that raised $3,000 to pay for lifesaving surgery for the dying service dog of a disabled homeless veteran and then pocketing the money. He responded on Twitter by claiming “the reports that I would let a dog die is shocking & insane.” Santos added, “Over the past 24hr I have received pictures of dogs I helped rescue throughout the years along with supportive messages.” Politico has reported that this alleged scam is being investigated by federal law enforcement. Questions have been raised about whether he had misappropriated other funds that he had raised on behalf of animal welfare.  He was charged with theft in Pennsylvania in 2017 in connection to writing bad checks to Amish dog breeders. The charges were eventually dismissed after Santos convinced law enforcement in the state that his checkbook was stolen.  The New York congressman also falsely claimed in a 2017 Seattle court hearing for a convicted fraudster that he worked for Goldman Sachs. Santos made that statement, according to Politico, at a bail hearing for Gustavo Ribeiro Trelha, who was eventually convicted of fraud for skimming card information from ATMs. The two men had previously shared an apartment in Florida. Trelha has since implicated Santos as being the mastermind behind the scheme in a sworn statement sent to federal law enforcement.  Santos has also pushed back against the claim that he dressed in drag while living in Brazil. A drag performer who goes by the name Eula Rochard told multiple outlets that Santos used to perform in drag under the name “Kitara Ravache.”  Santos initially mounted an aggressive denial on Twitter. “The most recent obsession from the media claiming that I am a drag Queen or ‘performed’ as a drag Queen is categorically false,” said the embattled New York Republican. “The media continues to make outrageous claims about my life while I am working to deliver results.”  Eventually, he conceded to reporters at LaGuardia Airport that he did dress in drag but that he was simply having “fun at a festival.”  What don’t we know?  We don’t know a lot. This ranges from basic facts about Santos’s biography to details about his dealings with the Brazilian criminal justice system, and everything in between, including where he actually lives.  But most importantly, we don’t know where Santos’s money comes from. The representative loaned his own campaign $700,000 during the 2022 cycle and claimed an income of $750,000. He also listed millions of dollars in assets including an apartment in Rio De Janeiro worth up to $1 million and a seven-figure savings account. It’s a major shift in fortune for someone who was evicted twice, in 2015 and 2017, for failing to pay rent and had been taken to court for not paying debts. Even in 2020, he reported income in only one category — compensation in excess of $5,000 paid by one source — with no other assets.  Santos initially provided no information on his finances on his media tour, except to concede that he owned no property. He had previously claimed on Twitter to be a landlord who owned 13 properties. The representative eventually claimed in an interview with Semafor that his newfound wealth came from “capital introduction” where he helped broker deals for the wealthy. Santos used a yacht sale as an example of how he earned a living: “If you’re looking at a $20 million yacht, my referral fee there can be anywhere between $200,000 and $400,000.”  What happens now?  In addition to the charges announced Wednesday, Santos is also being investigated by local prosecutors, while the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James has been “looking into some of the issues that have come out.” Further, a complaint has been filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) by the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center alleging Santos illegally hid the source of the money he loaned his campaign through a straw donor scheme and other alleged violations, including whether he used campaign funds to pay for personal expenses. The Washington Post reported in late January that the Justice Department has asked the FEC to hold off any enforcement actions so that it can pursue a criminal investigation.  Although Santos had originally accepted an assignment from House GOP leadership to sit on the science and small business committees, he announced on January 31 in a meeting of Republican lawmakers that he would step aside from those positions. The announcement came only a day after a closed-door meeting with McCarthy.  Dan Goldman, a fellow representative from New York and a former prosecutor, has suggested that Santos face criminal investigation for conspiracy to defraud the United States as well as filing false statements to the FEC.  In a December interview with Vox, Goldman shied away from weighing in on whether Santos should be denied his seat in Congress. “I think the bigger question is not whether I think George Santos should be a member of Congress. The bigger question is whether Kevin McCarthy and the Republican leadership think that George Santos should be a member of Congress.”  A number of Santos’s fellow Republicans have called on him to resign as well. The Nassau County Republican Party, long considered the most powerful county party in New York, called on Santos to step down as have other New York Republicans, including Reps. Anthony D’Esposito, Mike Lawler, Nick Langworthy, and Brandon Williams. Joe Cairo, the chair of the Nassau County GOP, told reporters, “George Santos’ campaign last year was a campaign of deceit, lies and fabrication” while demanding his resignation.  Rep. Max Miller (R-OH), one of only two Jewish Republicans in the House and a longtime Trump White House aide, called on Santos to resign in mid-January, and cited the New York Republican’s lies about his family ties to the Holocaust in doing so.  The result has left Santos in a state of limbo with no committee assignments and a constant pack of reporters following him around the Capitol. But, as McCarthy acknowledged to reporters, if the Ethics Committee finds that Santos broke the law, the New York Republican should be ousted from Congress. Further, there is new grist for the Ethics Committee with a prospective staffer accusing the New York Congress member in early February of sexual harassment.  However, as of now, McCarthy needs Santos almost as much as Santos needs McCarthy. McCarthy only became speaker by the skin of his teeth on the 15th ballot. With a narrow majority — and the likelihood of frequent member absences now that the House has gotten rid of proxy voting — McCarthy needs every vote he can get and Santos was the deciding vote on the Republican debt limit legislation in late April. He has so far demurred from calling on Santos to resign, but made clear that the New York Republican would have to step down if he is convicted.  Further, because Santos represents one of the most Democratic seats in Congress held by a Republican, forcing him to resign under any circumstance is risky. It would be a difficult seat for a Republican to hold in a special election and a loss would further imperil an already slim GOP majority.  In the meantime, it’s a matter of waiting for the next shoe to drop. As unsustainable as the current status quo might seem, the only impetus right now for Santos to resign would be a sense of shame, and it seems unlikely that he carries that burden.  Update, May 12, 12:05 pm: This story was originally published on December 21, 2022, and has been updated multiple times, most recently to include Santos’s confession to theft in Brazil.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nGeorge Santos, a newly elected New York Representative, has been indicted for wire fraud and money laundering. \nHe has been accused of lying about his résumé, falsely claiming to be Jewish, and misappropriating funds from a GoFundMe.\nHe has also been accused of dressing in drag and being the mastermind behind a fraud scheme.\nHe is currently facing calls for his resignation and investigations into potential criminal misconduct.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nGeorge Santos, a newly elected New York Representative, has been accused of lying about his biography and misappropriating funds.\nHe has been indicted for wire fraud and money laundering, and is facing calls for his resignation from fellow Republicans.\nHe has also been accused of falsely claiming to be Jewish and of stealing money from a GoFundMe campaign.\nHe has admitted to lying about his résumé and to stealing money, but denies other accusations.\nHe is currently under investigation by federal and local law enforcement."

        "text": "© Provided by TheStreet  It looks like former President Donald Trump will have some high-profile competition from his own party in the 2024 presidential election.  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will toss his hat into the presidential ring next week, The Wall Street Journal reported on May 18. While down significantly in the Republican primary polls, DeSantis should stand as Trump’s most serious competition to be the GOP’s candidate to run for the highest office in the land.  Don’t Miss: Powerful Billionaire Shocks Ron DeSantis  According to the Morning Consult, Trump leads DeSantis by 43 points in the Republican presidential primary. Meanwhile, pollsters at FiveThirtyEight have Trump running ahead of DeSantis by approximately 20 points as of May 17, 2023.  DeSantis is expected to file formal paperwork for a presidential run on May 25, a date which coincides with a major DeSantis donor meeting in Miami, Fla. An official announcement on a White House run is expected on or immediately after that date, The Journal reported.  DeSantis brings both baggage and benefits to a presidential run.  Governor of a Key State  Perhaps his greatest strength is that he's governor of a key battleground state. Florida is one of the biggest electoral vote prizes in presidential elections, making it closely fought over in every campaign cycle. DeSantis starts with a strong base in the state, having won reelection in 2022, in an off-year election that mostly saw disappointing results for Republicans.  Many Democrats have lambasted the Florida Governor for grappling with Disney, Florida’s largest private employer, pushing tough-on-crime laws and strict immigration laws, and controversial legislation banning discussions of gender and sex at state public schools. Yet those same laws have resonated with the GOP base, giving DeSantis a high national profile for the upcoming Republican primaries.  Depending on one’s political affiliation, DeSantis either succeeded or failed in his management of Florida’s COVID-19 response. The governor’s backers have long pointed to The Sunshine State’s re-opening public schools and private businesses before other states did. The move certainly opened the doors for locked-down citizens of other states to move to Florida during the pandemic, many of whom have stayed there permanently.  From April, 2020 to April, 2021, at the zenith of the pandemic, more than 330,000 people moved to Florida, according to the George Gibbs Center for Economic Prosperity.  Yet public health advocates were highly critical of Florida’s “open door” policy during COVID-19, pointing to public health risks by not mandating masks and opening public schools early, both of which were cited as significant pandemic risks by the U..S Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).  DeSantis is Testing the Waters  The “green light” on a White House run also comes at a time when DeSantis is testing the waters in key, early primary states.  Last week, DeSantis held rallies and pumped hands with voters in Iowa, one of the early caucus states. On Friday, May 19, DeSantis is set to meet with key legislators in New Hampshire, an early presidential primary state.  Former President Trump has been a frequent critic of DeSantis, who received Trump’s backing in the 2018 Florida Governor campaign, which DeSantis won over former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by a slim 0.4%.  Trump’s presidential campaign PAC, MAGA, Inc. has been deeply critical of DeSantis’ policies on a wide range of issues, especially on Social Security, Medicare, COVID, and most recently, on abortion.  Last week, Trump bashed Florida’s new six-week abortion ban, stating “Many people within the pro-life movement feel that was too harsh.”  In a rare rebuke of Trump, DeSantis offered a blunt response to the former President and future White House rival.  \"And I think that as a Florida resident, you know, he didn't give an answer about, 'Would you have signed the heartbeat bill that Florida did?'\" he said Tuesday. \"I signed the bill. I was proud to do it. He will not answer whether he would sign it or not.\"  Expect more of the same as DeSantis makes it official that he’s running for president.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis will announce his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election next week. \nDeSantis is currently trailing Donald Trump in the Republican primary polls.\nDeSantis is the governor of a key battleground state and has a strong base in Florida.\nDeSantis has been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and has recently been rebuked by Trump.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to announce his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election next week, making him the most serious competition to former President Donald Trump in the Republican primary.\nDeSantis has a strong base in Florida, a key battleground state, and has resonated with the GOP base with his tough-on-crime and immigration laws.\nHowever, his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has been controversial.\nTrump has been critical of DeSantis, and the two have already exchanged barbs in the lead up to the official announcement."

Tapper opened his interview Durbin on State of the Union by asking what the Senate Judiciary Committee will do to scrutinize Justice Clarence Thomas over the newly-revealed payments his wife received from a right-wing judicial activist. But the conversation eventually moved to the committee’s paralysis due to Feinstein’s extended sick leave, and the recurring questions of whether she is still capable of fulfilling her duties.  “At what point,” Tapper asked, “do the tens of millions of voters currently lacking full representation in the Senate from California — at what point do they matter more than the feelings of a colleague whose health has been in question for a long time?”  Durbin expressed hope for Feinstein’s return, admitting “We need her” and “It is a challenge in the Senate Judiciary Committee to do our business [without her].”  “I hope she does what is best for her and her family and the state of California and makes a decision soon as to whether she is coming back.”  Feinstein’s future has been the root of difficult questions for many (but not all) Democrats. As such, Tapper compared Feinstein’s situation to what happened to the judicial landscape when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died while still serving on the Supreme Court — rather than retiring when Democrats had the chance to replace her.  Tapper: I mean, all due respect, sir. You and your fellow Democrats were very ginger and very polite when it came to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and not pushing her to retire when you had a Democratic majority in the Senate. How’d that work out for you? How’d that work out for Roe V. Wade? Durbin: Well, I can tell you that you can play these out and try to guess what the court opinions resulting from it will be. The bottom line is, though, we have in the past had members of the Senate — I can think of a handful as I sit here, Democrats and Republicans — who have been absent because of medical conditions for lengthy periods of time. I want to treat Dianne Feinstein fairly. I want to be sensitive to her family situation and her personal situation. I don’t want to say that she is going to be put under more pressure than others have in the past, but the bottom line is, the business of the committee and of the Senate is affected by her absence.

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Hunter Biden  In what has become a fabulous bit of political branding by the Republican Party, the 51 former intelligence operatives who signed a letter arguing that Hunter Biden’s laptop scandal, which risked derailing Joe Biden’s 2020 Presidential bid, was Russian disinformation, are being called “The Spies Who Lie.”  As they say in the Russian fairytale, Cinderella, if the shoe fits…  After all, it turns out that the 51 intelligence operatives who signed the letter did so at the behest of none other than longtime Biden bagman, Antony Blinken (who is now the Biden Administration’s secretary of state).  The letter was disseminated at a point in the 2020 campaign that, if the Hunter Biden laptop story went unanswered by the Democrats, would have sunk the Biden Campaign.  Hunter Biden and Your Lying Letters  Indeed, polling after the 2020 election indicated that had the American voters known the extent of the scandalous materials found on Hunter Biden’s laptop, they would have voted for Donald Trump.  The Biden Campaign knew this, as did the 51 allies of the Democratic Party who just so happened to be former intelligence professionals. That was why they crafted the letter of lies and signed it—to give Joe Biden’s ailing 2020 campaign cover from Trump’s vicious attacks on the matter.  The US intelligence community (IC), with the exception of organizations like the FBI, is barred from operating on American soil. The powerful tools that the IC has at its disposal are forbidden from being used against the American people—especially during an election year.  Further, these rules extend to former intelligence officials as much as they do active intelligence officers.  These standards exist to protect what is supposed to be the non-partisan IC from politicization as much as they are designed to protect our democracy from an unelected, shadowy bureaucracy that can wield immense, unchecked power over our lives. Ironically, the 51 individuals who used their credentials to help to shield Joe Biden’s campaign in 2020 were doing so in the name of “our democracy.”  Yet, in the name of our democracy, they essentially violated basic democratic norms—and the tenets of their profession—to ensure that the will of the American voter could be subverted and manipulated in wholly undemocratic ways.  The Donald Trump Apocalypse  As an aside, far from being Russian disinformation, as the letter claimed, it turned out that the letter itself was Democratic Party disinformation meant to obscure the truthful reportage on Hunter Biden’s laptop from Hell.  The kingpin of the (now former) supposed “Intellectual Dark Web”, author Sam Harris summed up the mentality of the Left and, obviously, a chunk of the IC as it related to Joe Biden’s campaign against Donald Trump in 2020: they wouldn’t have cared if Hunter Biden had “corpses of dead children in his basement.”  According to the mentality of those who concocted the letter falsely claiming that the Hunter Biden laptop story was nothing more than Russian disinformation, they were content to preside over a “Left-wing conspiracy” to prevent a political rival from being fairly elected.  That’s because Trump represented something obviously different in their view. As Harris infamously said, Trump was the equivalent of a planet-killing asteroid speeding toward Earth.  At the risk of maundering, I suppose in Harris’ view, the Democrats were like the rag-tag group of oil drillers in the 1998 film Armageddon, being sent against all the odds to the asteroid surface to drill a hole there, plant a nuke, and blow the asteroid up from the inside before it could hit Earth.  Of course, this is an imperfect analogy because the Democrats hate fossil fuels and loathe blue-collar-types with a passion. Maybe these types of men remind them of their fathers or the kids who used to bully them at lunchtime when they were children.  Still, these were the apocalyptic terms in which the Left viewed President Trump.  It’s why they giddily broke every norm and shattered every institutional guardrail of our hallowed democracy to pursue Trump and defeat him in 2020—even weaponizing intelligence operatives and, ostensibly their agencies, to achieve such a herculean task.  The Russia Collusion Lie Connection to the Hunter Biden Laptop Letter  It's interesting to see just who was involved in the signing of this letter.  The list is a compendium of the who’s-who of politicized intel operators. Notably, James Clapper, the former Obama era Director of National Intelligence (who, a former colleague of his once described to me as a “Red Diaper Baby”) is now scheduled to appear before the House committee investigating the letter.  Clapper was one of the architects of what became known as the “Russia collusion delusion.” Former Obama CIA Director John Brennan and a multitude of others who were key players in the Russian collusion lie that sucked up the first two years of Trump’s presidency signed on to the Hunter Biden laptop disinformation letter.  As a reminder, during the 2016 Presidential Election, Donald Trump and senior campaign aides were accused of either being compromised by Russian intelligence or willing agents of influence for Russian intelligence.  Russia’s goal, according to the Democrats, the Obama Administration, and Hillary Clinton’s disastrous presidential campaign in 2016, was to undermine Clinton’s chances of being president because she represented such a grave threat to Russian strategic interests whereas Trump was a pal of Putin’s (because during the campaign he earnestly stated that he wanted to have good relations with Putin and other world leaders).  This piece is not about debunking all the ways that the Russian collusion delusion was not just inaccurate but that it was a patent and grotesque fabrication behind which the IC got as a means to undermine, impugn, and ultimately destroy Trump’s presidency.  That has been proven over the last five years. First, the FBI director who was tapped to be the special counsel leading the investigation into Trump-Russia ties, Robert Mueller, concluded that there was no collusion between Trump and Russian intelligence in 2016.  Then, the Department of Justice (DOJ) attorney, John Durham, who was asked by former President Trump to investigate the Hillary Clinton campaign for spreading disinformation about his purported ties to Russia, found that the FBI should have never even opened any investigation into accusations of Trump-Russia collusion.  What I find fascinating is that, for all of Trump’s expansive conspiracy theories, there was a real, very dangerous (for our democracy) conspiracy afoot from the moment that Trump announced his unlikely bid for the presidency in 2016.  If anything, the existence of this ridiculous letter signed by the very same geniuses who brought us the Russia collusion myth in 2016, proves that such a deranged conspiracy existed to oust Trump.  The most troubling part in this whole affair is that their multi-year plan, sadly, worked.  While I fear that Donald Trump has gone off the deep end, he is right about one thing: this country—including him—deserves a little bit of revenge for the abuses that these pampered princes (and princesses) of the intelligence community proudly engaged in to undermine and weaken the very democratic state that they were sworn to protect.  The Spies Who Betrayed Their Constitutional Oaths  The former intelligence officials who signed the letter obfuscating the public’s attention away from the legitimate scandal of Hunter Biden’s laptop from Hell are not only the “spies who lied”, they are enemies of the state who have betrayed their oaths to the US Constitution.  And they’re being rewarded for it.  More ominously, the Democratic Party disinformation letter signed by those 51 political hacks masquerading as intelligence operatives had a truly creepy addendum to conclude the list of signatures. The final line of the letter states that, “nine additional former IC officers who cannot be named publicly also support the arguments in this letter.”  Just to translate, that means that these nine people remain dug into the national security bureaucracy like ticks on a bull’s ass in a Wyoming summer and they do not want to identify themselves and paint a target on their backs.  They’ll Do It to the Next Republican President…  This is because they represent an entire cadre of bureaucrats in the nat-sec community who are operating essentially as poison pill personnel for the next Republican administration. They will be brought into positions of trust based on their credentials and experience and then subvert the “totally Hitler” next GOP leader in the White House.  Irrespective of your political opinion, the fact that this scandal has persisted for as long as it has should worry every American.  Our government cannot serve We, The People, so long as there exists a counter, shadow government inside of it. The next president must make dismantling this shadow government a key tenet of their campaign.  Otherwise, our democracy is truly doomed.

        "text": "© Thomson Reuters Trump rally in Texas By Brad Brooks and Daniel Trotta LUBBOCK, Texas (Reuters) - Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton lashed out on Friday against his critics trying to impeach him, saying that removing him from office would be a gift for President Joe Biden and his Democratic agenda. Paxton, a conservative firebrand and ally of former President Donald Trump, has been accused by fellow Republicans of abuse of office and faces a vote on 20 articles of impeachment in the Texas House on Saturday. Staking out a position on the far right on divisive cultural issues, Paxton has sued the Biden administration nearly 50 times in an attempt to halt what he labeled \"unlawful tyrannical policies\" on issues including immigration, gun rights and business regulation. On Thursday, the five-member Texas House General Investigating Committee voted unanimously to recommend that Paxton be impeached and removed from office for improperly aiding a wealthy political donor, conducting a sham investigation against whisteblowers in his office whom he fired, and covering up his wrongdoing in a separate federal securities fraud case against him, among other offenses. Addressing the media but without taking questions on the eve of the vote, Paxton accused House members including the Republican majority of plotting an \"illegal impeachment scheme\" led by corrupt politicians loyal to House Speaker Dade Phelan. Debate was due to start at 1 p.m. CDT (1800 GMT). If impeached, Paxton would be removed from office pending a trial in the Senate, where his wife, Angela Paxton, is a senator and where he said he believed he would get a fair trial. A two-thirds vote is needed to permanently expel him. \"I want to invite my fellow citizens and friends to peacefully come let their voices be heard at the Capitol tomorrow. Exercise your right to petition your government. Let's restore the power of this great state to the people instead of to the politicians,\" Paxton said. With many of the accusations against him already aired, Paxton easily won reelection last year after fending off a Republican primary challenge from George P. Bush, a scion of two former presidents. Paxton's resiliency - and the ease with which he dispatched Bush in his 2022 primary contest - reflects a shift within the state Republican Party over the past decade from the business-friendly wing squarely into the social conservative camp.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton is facing a vote on 20 articles of impeachment in the Texas House on Saturday. \nPaxton has sued the Biden administration nearly 50 times in an attempt to halt what he labeled \"unlawful tyrannical policies\". \nPaxton easily won reelection last year after fending off a Republican primary challenge from George P.

        "text": "© Raw Story Fox News/screen grab  Republican strategist Karl Rove suggested former President Donald Trump damaged his re-election chances with his performance at Wednesday's CNN town hall.  During a Thursday appearance on Fox News, Rove argued that Trump's town hall appearance turned off independents. The Republican strategist displayed a whiteboard with his talking points.  \"To the true believers, this was a great evening. They saw their hero,\" Rove said. \"But what dominated the evening? There were basically four issues. There was a big consternation over was the 2020 election stolen, and he continued to assert that it was. There was a lot of talk about January 6th.\"  \"He said, I'm going to pardon a lot of those people for January 6th,\" he continued. \"So now we're going to have continuing questions to him as a candidate. Are you going to pardon the Oath Keepers? Are you going to pardon the Proud Boys?\"  Rove predicted that the answers to who Trump would pardon \"are not going to be particularly helpful.\"  \"So the question is going to be, last night, this was good for the true believers, but the election will be decided by independents,\" Rove noted. \"Donald Trump got 7 million fewer votes in 2020 than Joe Biden did. And the question is, are any of these issues going to add to his numbers? And my sense is, no, they aren't.\"  The Republican strategist said Trump also had a problem because a large portion of his base believed the criminal charges against him in New York City were legitimate.  \"But if a quarter of Republicans say it's justified, he's got a problem inside his base,\" Rove observed. \"And nothing that he said last night, in my mind, does much to get him people who voted against him or didn't vote at all in 2020.\"  Watch the video from Fox News at this link.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  This is a story about weed (i.e., marijuana or cannabis), and it’s a story about greed — greed on the government’s part, which encourages more greed on the part of those willing to break the law for profit.  There has been a long-running debate over legalizing the recreational use of drugs, especially marijuana. Proponents argued that legalization – or at least decriminalization – would undermine black market sales of those drugs. Prices would fall and organized crime and gangs, which have long profited from the distribution and sale of illegal drugs, would diminish. Meanwhile, the government could regulate vendors to ensure quality and safety and, most important to the politicians, tax their sales.  While I never agreed with the argument, it didn’t seem unreasonable. What was needed was a test case to prove the theory. Now we have one.  Twenty-two states have legalized the recreational sale and use of cannabis, and for many of them the theory has, well, gone up in smoke.  The federal status of cannabis has not changed. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), “The FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and DEA have concluded that marijuana has no federally approved medical use for treatment in the U.S. and thus it remains as a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law.”  Whether that assessment is correct or not, that hasn’t stopped several states. According to the Tax Foundation, “Recreational marijuana taxation is one of the hottest policy issues in the U.S.”  The sales and excise tax rates imposed on the product can vary significantly from state to state. And in some cases, cities add their own sales tax.  Washington state, for example, imposes a 37 percent sales tax on the retail price of marijuana, Virginia has a 21 percent tax, Montana 20 percent, Oregon 17 percent and Vermont 14 percent. Several states impose an excise tax on both the wholesale and the retail price. Others tax the amount a customer buys.  Excessive tax rates on any product or service always encourage some people to game the system or move to the black market.  But high tax rates aren’t the only stumbling block. Several states have a fairly arduous application-and-approval processes for becoming a licensed marijuana vendor. In some states it can take months for an application to move through the licensing process and still be denied a license. That opens the door for vendors to ignore the process and begin selling the product anyway. And if they ignore the licensing process, they can ignore collecting the tax.  Wall Street Journal reporters Zusha Elinson and Jimmy Vielkind recently looked at what’s happening to the cannabis market in California and New York. Seven years after California legalized the production and sale of marijuana, “Unlicensed sales totaled $8.1 billion last year, dwarfing legal sales of $5.4 billion, according to estimates by New Frontier Data, a cannabis analytics firm.”  The reporters cite one cannabis industry consultant saying, “When you start seeing tax rates that are approaching 30 to 40 percent on products, it’s really going to be difficult to compete against the remnants of an illegal market.”  For example, Los Angeles has a 10 percent city cannabis tax, then there’s a 15 percent state sales tax on the product, plus a standard 9.5 percent sales tax.  Maybe that’s one reason Los Angeles has 354 licensed marijuana shops but between 700 and 1,000 unlicensed shops and delivery services.  As for New York, after two years, “just five shops sell marijuana legally in New York City, while 1,400 bodegas, smoke shops and other outlets without licenses do, according to an estimate by the city sheriff.” Many of those unlicensed shops openly advertise their products because the city is so lax about enforcing the restrictions.  While several of the states have done a better job of controlling the black market, it’s always there. And the reality of interstate commerce means that even states that have not legalized recreational marijuana get caught up in the act.  Oklahoma allowed the commercial cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes in 2018, and now, “The Sooner State has become the biggest source of black-market weed in the country, the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics estimated this month.”  Once the government gets greedy and starts imposing very high taxes, it encourages a black market where safety regulations, quality controls and sanitation may be lacking. As soon as illegal vendors realize that they can cut some corners and save money, they get greedy too, hoping to reap outsized profits.  Greedy politicians always push for high tax rates, which leads to gaming the system or illegal activity. Greed leads to more greed, and especially with weed.

        "text": "© John Fordham/Getty Images Parade marches walking in support of trans kids during the Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade as part of Sydney WorldPride on February 25, 2023 in Sydney, Australia. The Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade returns to Oxford Street in celebration of the event's 45th anniversary. The parade began in 1978 as a march to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York and has been held every year since to promote awareness of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered issues.  Every year on June 1, when Pride Month begins, conservative media and commentators start complain about Pride events. It happens like clockwork: They argue that Pride has gone too far. They whine about corporations that participate. And they argue that it is time to kill Pride.  Let me be the first \"conservative commentator\" to say that no, it is not time to kill Pride. There will never be a time to kill Pride because there is a rationale for it that still holds water.  Gay and lesbian Pride events started in America because gays and lesbians were beaten in the streets, banned from congregating together, and lived under the constant threat of being fired for their jobs due to their same-sex attraction.  But the complaining conservatives are right about one thing: That rationale has been undermined in 2023. Pride has unfortunately turned into a free-for-all in which people parade their sexual fetishes in public and corporations are bullied into supporting this nonsense for fear they'll be seen as \"homophobic\" or \"anti-LGBT.\"  That is not how Pride started, and it's time to get back to basics.  The earliest pride events were started and organized not by the \"trans women of color\" that far-Left LGBTQ activists and revisionist historians would like you to believe started them, but by run of the mill (and, yes, mostly white) gays and lesbians who had the social, financial, and political capital to organize in support of basic rights: the right to be seen. The right to exist. The right to gather in public.  Eventually, those rights started expanding to the fight for marriage equality, the freedom from employment discrimination, and the freedom to serve in the military—a right that I was once arrested at the White House for protesting to secure.  But here's the thing: That equality was achieved. In 2011, the repeal of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" law that barred gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military went into effect. In 2015, gays and lesbians in America gained the right to be married (and divorced) like any other American. Then, in 2020, a conservative-majority Supreme Court ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects LGBT people from employment discrimination. And just last year, the Respect For Marriage Act became law, ensuring that the hard-won rights of gays and lesbians would not be eliminated by the political whims of any incoming administration.  That success caused a problem for Pride events, apparently. Because what we're seeing now at Pride events across the country has nothing to do with hardworking gays and lesbians fighting for equality before the law. It's no longer about same-sex attracted men and women celebrating their hard-won achievement of full equality, nor is it about giving gay and lesbian-identifying teens and young adults an outlet for the free expression we should all have in our youth.  Instead, Pride events have become nearly entirely centered on a transgender and \"queer\" fringe that is myopically focused on pushing what is all too often an agenda focused on children that is far out of step with the general public's views on these controversial issues. Mainstream adults had no problem with drag queens until these activists decided that they needed to read stories to small children. And most people have no idea what to think about the very recent and deeply experimental medications and surgeries given to young teens who identify as transgender. And yet, this activist fringe says that if you do not think exactly what they tell you to think about this, you're a \"bigot.\" And they have the backing of major corporations to help them do so.  June is the month when corporations across America fall over themselves to change their logos into rainbow colors, and most have adopted the so-called \"progress flag\" that includes the transgender stripes as well as black and brown stripes to \"include\" trans people and gays and lesbians of color, injecting race and gender ideology onto a symbol that was never meant to include either. By adopting this now controversial symbol, corporations are injecting themselves into a culture war they wanted nothing to do with. Yet embracing these displays has little to do with the acceptance of gays and lesbians that the vast majority of Americans now have, and everything to do with the ideologies of the activist fringe.  If a corporation embraces the Pride flag, they're now embracing Drag Queen Story Hour, the medical and social transitioning of minors, and the radical gender ideology that has taken hold of the movement and turned pride month into the never-ending fiasco of cultural Marxism that it has become. As Target and Bud Light have found out over the past few weeks after wading into entirely avoidable controversies, this now has real consequences and implications for businesses.  The answer, however, is not to eliminate Pride Month or Pride events. That's foolish and backward thinking, and there is far too much corporate money along with billions of dollars in gay and lesbian buying power involved at this point.  The answer is to rein it all in. The answer is to give companies and corporations an off-ramp from insanity, to let them know that it's OK to support gays and lesbians without wading into deeply controversial waters of gender ideology, Drag Queen Story Hour, and the medical transitioning of minors. They can support gay and lesbian Americans without being held hostage by the Human Rights Campaign or GLAAD or any number of LGBT-oriented organizations that have been captured and overtaken by the TQ fringe.  As the founder of a media platform called StopWoke, the co-founder of a consultancy designed to advise corporations how to express support for diverse groups without wading into controversial or deeply political waters and as an openly gay man, I believe that there is power in Pride events. As critical of them as I am, I still do attend certain ones even to this day. Gays and lesbians will always need a place to feel comfortable, affirmed, and accepted, both in the workplace and in real life. This is something that the anti-Pride activists on the Right do not and will never understand.  As long as there is a gay or lesbian teenager that feels uncomfortable with who they are, or a gay or lesbian adult that feels unsafe walking down the street with their partner—and there always will be—then there will be a reason for Pride. What it has turned into doesn't seem to be working for anyone—but what it started as and what it can be again is something worth fighting for, not ending.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  It was 2016 all over again Wednesday night as former President Donald Trump took part in a raucous town hall filled with incendiary claims and jabs at the network.  Trump fielded questions from CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Republican voters in Manchester, N.H., for more than an hour about his false claims surrounding the 2020 election, his myriad of legal troubles, abortion, the war in Ukraine, immigration and the economy. It was Trump’s first appearance on the network since 2016.  While Trump’s advisers explained that the former president was returning to the network he routinely lambasts as “fake news” to reach a wider audience, the former president largely offered up the same type of pugilistic politics that defined his 2016 campaign and his four years in the White House.  “That was a rigged election,” Trump said just minutes into the town hall of his 2020 election loss.  Asked if he had any regrets about his conduct around Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol to halt the certification of President Biden’s victory, Trump defended those who came to Washington, D.C.  “I’ve never spoken to a crowd as large as this,” Trump said. “That was because they thought the election was rigged. And they were there proud. They were there with love in their heart. That was an unbelievable and it was a beautiful day.”  At one point, he removed notes from his jacket pocket and read out loud tweets he sent that day where he held back on calling the crowd off.  Collins routinely interjected to note that the election was not rigged, that Trump’s own former officials testified as much, and that numerous lawsuits alleging fraud were dismissed by the courts.  When Collins pressed Trump on whether he would accept the 2024 election outcome, he couched his answer to say he would only do so if he felt the results were “honest.”  Trump, who fact-checkers found told thousands of lies throughout his presidency, repeatedly offered up inaccurate or misleading talking points. In one instance, he claimed that residents of the Chinatown neighborhood in Washington, D.C., did not speak English as part of an allegation that Biden stored boxes there after his vice presidency because he had nefarious ties to Beijing.  Collins sought to chime in throughout the night to pushback on some of Trump’s false claims and press him when he danced around questions but he frequently spoke over her.  Trump repeatedly declined to say whether he would sign a federal abortion ban if reelected, instead calling the end of Roe v. Wade a “great victory” and saying he would find “a solution that’s going to work.”  Collins at one point asked Trump twice whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia after Moscow launched an invasion in February 2022, and the former president demurred.  “I don’t think in terms of winning and losing. I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all of these people,” Trump said.  Asked if Russian President Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, Trump said the issue “should be discussed later.”  Over the course of the town hall, Trump grew irritated with Collins’ repeated interjections seeking answers and clarifying facts.  As Collins pushed Trump on why he held onto classified materials after leaving the White House when he knew the federal government was seeking them, Trump finally snapped.  “You’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said to cheers from those in attendance.  The crowd in Manchester was made up of Republican voters and was largely favorable for Trump. Attendees cheered the former president throughout the night, including when he pulled from his jacket pocket a printout of tweets he sent on Jan. 6 urging his supporters to stand down.  The audience also laughed as Trump mockingly recounted writer E. Jean Carroll’s allegation that he raped her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s. A nine-person jury this week found Trump liable of sexual abuse and defamation in the case.  “I have no idea who the hell she is. She’s a whack job,” Trump said.  Asked if he thought the jury’s findings would keep women from voting from him, Trump said he did not believe it would.  Trump’s reception from the crowd underscored his team’s belief that he is the prohibitive favorite to win the Republican nomination in 2024, and polls have consistently shown him with a sizable lead over would-be challengers like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).  His campaign took a victory lap after the town hall, declaring Trump “is the only one who can stop the forces from destroying our country—anyone else will be ripped to shreds.”  But his attacks on Collins and the woman who accused him of rape, as well as his unwillingness to rule out a federal abortion ban and his repeated falsehoods about the 2020 election were reflective of why President Biden and Democrats believe they can defeat Trump once again in 2024.  “It’s simple, folks. Do you want four more years of that?” Biden posted on his personal Twitter account at the conclusion of the town hall. “If you don’t, pitch in to our campaign.”  Even some Republicans argued the town hall was proof it was time for the party to move on from Trump.  Erin Perrine, a spokesperson for the pro-DeSantis group Never Back Down, said the event showed “Trump is stuck in the past.”  “After 76 years, Trump still doesn’t know where he stands on important conservative issues like supporting life and the 2nd amendment,” Perrine said in a statement. “How does that Make America Great Again?” <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFormer President Donald Trump took part in a raucous town hall on CNN Wednesday night, where he repeated false claims about the 2020 election and defended those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. \nTrump refused to say whether he would accept the 2024 election outcome if he felt it was not \"honest\" and declined to call Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal. \nTrump's reception from the crowd underscored his team's belief that he is the prohibitive favorite to win the Republican nomination in 2024. \nPresident Biden responded to the town hall by asking if people wanted four more years of Trump, and some Republicans argued it was time for the party to move on from him.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFormer President Donald Trump took part in a raucous town hall on CNN Wednesday night, fielding questions from Republican voters and the network's Kaitlan Collins.\nTrump defended his false claims surrounding the 2020 election, his legal troubles, and his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\nHe also refused to rule out a federal abortion ban and made inaccurate and misleading statements.\nPresident Biden responded to the town hall by asking if people wanted four more years of Trump, while some Republicans argued it was time to move on from him."

        "text": "© Raw Story Photo via Jim LoScalzo/AFP  Far-right groups are complaining about being included in a Department of Homeland Security chart called the \"Pathways toward terrorism\" which includes research on terrorism and political violence and was written in 2008 by Sophia Moskalenko and Clark McCauley.  The researchers show how radicalization generally increases from benign political involvement, \"increasing extremity of beliefs, feelings, and behaviors in support of intergroup conflict and violence,\" the study's abstract explains. \"Across individuals, groups, and mass publics, twelve mechanisms of radicalization are distinguished.\"  So, political activism on the right can begin at the party level and slowly increase to anti-government militias, it says.  The Heritage Foundation was quickly triggered by being included in the bottom rung of the pyramid among the right entry-level groups. One piece they were miffed about was a researcher's comments that fringe extremists can infiltrate groups or rallies. For example, anti-government activists saw the COVID lockdowns as a unique opportunity for recruitment. The same happened on the left when the 1999 Seattle anti-WTO and Occupy Wall Street protesters were opportunities for anarchists.  The argument from the right is that President Joe Biden's administration is weaponizing the government against Republicans. Still, the administration explains that domestic terrorists come from far-right groups like those at the Jan. 6 attacks. Militia groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were working with Republican Party leaders and lawmakers.  Speaking to Fox Business on Thursday, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), behind the so-called \"weaponization\" committee investigation, expressed outrage.  \"This is really scary too,\" Jordan said. \"But this is consistent, frankly, with what President Biden said last fall at Independence Hall with that eery background he had where he called half of the country fascists.\"  Jordan's reference was the Biden speech about \"MAGA extremists,\" generally considered as the people who attacked the U.S. capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  Jordan says that this belief exists in far too many U.S. Leaders.  Republicans have consistently attacked investigations into domestic terrorism. In the Feb. 2021 House Homeland Security, the FBI explained that there has been a steady rise in domestic extremism and violence.  “There’s no question in my mind that the rhetoric inflamed it and turned the boiling water from a hot pot of water to overflowing,” said Rep. John Katko (R-NY).  Yet, throughout the Donald Trump presidency, the administration \"steps to weaken the federal government’s response to the growing crisis,\" American Oversight claimed at the time.

Special counsel Jack Smith is wrapping up his investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago and some of Trump's close associates are \"bracing for his indictment and anticipate being able to fundraise off a prosecution,\" The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.  Trump hours after the report published a letter from his attorneys to Garland alleging that he was being \"treated unfairly\" by Smith.  \"No President of the United States has ever, in the history of our country, been baselessly investigated in such an outrageous and unlawful fashion,\" Trump attorneys John Rowley and Jim Trusty wrote in the letter. \"We request a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss the ongoing injustice that is being perpetrated by your Special Counsel and his prosecutors.\"  It's unclear whether Garland would accept such a meeting.  \"Merrick Garland will not meet with Trusty or any of the other Trump lawyers,\" former Garland spokesperson Anthony Coley told The New York Times. \"Jack Smith is running this investigation, not Merrick Garland.\"  Former Watergate prosecutor Jill Wine-Banks called the letter \"wrong in so many ways,\" rejecting the lawyers' claims.  The \"investigation is well founded in facts,\" she wrote on Twitter, adding that President Richard Nixon was also \"investigated for his crimes, although Trump's are more numerous and far worse for democracy.\"  \"The lack of seriousness of sending this letter is evidenced by their putting it on Trump's social media,\" she wrote.

        "text": "© Provided by Talking Points Memo beto-abbott-election-overturn2 The Texas state legislature is poised to pass a bill allowing the secretary of state to overturn election results in the state’s most populous county, only a few years after it turned blue. On May 2, the Republican-controlled state Senate passed Senate Bill 1993, which, if it passes the state House as expected, would grant Secretary of State Jane Nelson (R) the authority to order a new election in counties with at least 2.7 million people if at least 2% of their polling places run out of ballots. Under these circumstances, only Harris County fits the bill. Harris County, Texas, has a population of over 4.7 million people, which includes the city of Houston. It became the focus of right-wing uproar during the 2022 midterms, when polling places encountered technical difficulties—delayed polling site openings, a paper ballot shortage, and staffing issues—that state Republicans have characterized as “election improprieties.” Harris County is also one of the most populous and diverse counties in the state, and it’s shifted blue over the past few years. Experts told TPM that SB 1993 is clearly a Republican attempt to regain control of a region that slipped out of its grasp. As the most populous county in the state, election administrators have occasionally run into the kind of problems that often come up in counties with large urban populations on Election Day. “Harris County elections have had room for improvement for a very long time,” Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee (D) told TPM. Last March, for example, County Supervisor of Elections Isabel Longoria announced that she would resign, a day after it was revealed that about 10,000 mail ballots weren’t counted in the primary election due to an “oversight.” “Ultimately, the buck stops with me to address these issues and conduct elections on behalf of the voters,” she said during a tense county commissioners meeting. “I didn’t meet my own standards.” But critics say that the state GOP only made such a fuss after Harris County began shifting blue. “Republicans often want to take power from officials who are elected at a local level because we see the world differently than they do,” Menefee told TPM. “And they’re trying to supplant the will of the voters who put us in office to run local government out here in Harris County.” Several major cities in Texas have shifted Democratic in the last two decades, but particularly since 2016, when former president Donald Trump took office and Harris County arguably first shifted from purple to blue. That pattern continued in 2018 as counties that used to be reliably red flipped—thanks to a groundswell of support for Beto O’Rourke, who was then running to replace Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Since Cruz won reelection by only about two percentage points, Republicans have tried to tip the state’s elections back in their favor, Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, told TPM. “There were attempts to change election rules, rules around the conduct of elections, rules around voting and how you can cast a vote that continue in this most recent bill material,” he said. “Republicans are saying given what we’ve seen, and given the changing demographics of Texas, we better try to get out in front of this before the entire state gets competitive.” Correction: This article incorrectly identified Harris County’s population rank in the state. It is the most populous county in the state and third most populous county in the country. TPM regrets this error.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe Texas state legislature is passing a bill that would allow the Secretary of State to overturn election results in Harris County, the most populous county in the state. \nHarris County has shifted blue in the past few years, leading to Republican attempts to regain control of the region. \nThe bill is a response to technical difficulties encountered during the 2022 midterms, which Republicans have characterized as \"election improprieties\". \nRepublicans are trying to tip the state's elections back in their favor due to changing demographics in Texas.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe Texas state legislature is set to pass a bill that would give the Secretary of State the power to order a new election in Harris County, the most populous county in the state, if at least 2% of its polling places run out of ballots.\nThis bill is seen as a Republican attempt to regain control of a region that has shifted blue in recent years, due to a groundswell of support for Beto O'Rourke in 2018.\nCritics argue that the state GOP is only making a fuss after Harris County began shifting blue, and that they are trying to supplant the will of the voters."

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Joe Biden  Impeach Joe Biden for His Many Crimes:  Hunter Biden has been a source of controversy for many years.  A man known for his many appetites, Hunter was more than a lost son of a bent political father.  He appears to be, as was seems to be proven throughout the House GOP’s ongoing investigation into his international business dealings, the frontman for a much more extensive criminal network organized for one purpose: to enrich the Biden Family by trading access to Joe Biden’s various political offices with foreign entities in exchange for barrels of cash.  Even the Washington Post is starting to raise important questions about Hunter Biden’s business and the forces he was representing.  Nepotism is the lifeblood of Washington, D.C. Idiot relatives incapable of getting an actual job are often brought into the offices of their more famous, successful elected family members.  Whereas the elected leaders of America are supposed to disclose their tax filings and income to the public, their family members are not required by law to do so—even if their family members are working for them.  The GOP Investigation  This is why the Republicans are so interested in Hunter Biden.  The GOP has already determined that multiple members of the Biden Family received boatloads of money over the years from various limited liability corporations (LLC) affiliated with Hunter Biden’s various overseas business ventures.  And just what were those business ventures?  Why were senior Chinese businessmen who were closely affiliated with the highest members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) giving millions of dollars to Hunter Biden or diamond rings that were worth $80,000?  It shouldn’t take a genius to recognize that Hunter Biden was moving money around for his family. Specifically, he was enriching his father—and the rest of this family.  What skills or qualifications did Hunter Biden bring to the various international consulting gigs he supposedly performed?  He wasn’t a very well accomplished individual; despite all the benefits he was given by being the son of a powerful member of America’s corrupt political class.  Hunter has admitted to as much in what he believed were private text messages with his oldest daughter over What’s App. Hunter Biden had no idea that those messages would be saved on his personal laptop, which he brought into a Delaware computer repair center after it stopped working properly.  Once he handed it over to the computer repair center, the technician working on the device saw many disturbing images and other things that he believed were criminal. Thus, the computer repair man alerted the FBI and began sharing information he obtained from the computer with the press.  More on the “Laptop from Hell”  This was the basis of what Miranda Devine brilliantly labeled as the “Laptop from Hell.” The Republicans investigating Hunter have been able to build their case from data points related to the laptop.  From there, they’ve managed to piece together more information that has led them to the devastating conclusion that the corruption of the Biden Family does not start and stop with the First Son, Hunter.  Rep. James Comer (R-KY), who is leading the House GOP investigation into the Hunter Biden scandal, is convinced that all roads lead back to Joe Biden. The forty-sixth president spent years building up what amounts to a family-run crime syndicate (or so that’s what Comer believes).  Because Joe Biden couldn’t be directly involved in the corruption without it getting out to the press and public, he shielded himself by having his degenerate son run everything for him. Hunter was the go-between the family business’ foreign clients and Joe Biden himself.  This is the basis of the infamous “ten percent for the Big Guy” text that a former business colleague of Hunter’s had shared with the press when he came forward to disclose the extent and nature of Hunter Biden’s criminal activities.  Joe Biden is Going Down  Should Rep. Comer’s investigation in the House lead to Joe Biden’s involvement in this scandalous, corrupt business, being outed, articles of impeachment will have to be drawn up if Joe Biden wins reelection.  Contrary to what you’ve heard, the scandals of the Trump Administration pale in comparison to the widespread, decades-long corruption that the Biden Syndicate has engaged in. Their wealth was ill-gotten. They have been compromised by multiple foreign actors—notably China, America’s number one rival in the world today—and Joe Biden holds the most powerful office in the world.  Regardless of the outcome of the next election, Joe Biden must be held accountable. It is through Hunter Biden that the GOP will discover just how pervasive the Biden Family’s corruption is and how deep Joe Biden’s involvement in that corruption truly is.  That can only mean impeachment.  MORE: Hunter Biden Could Finally Be Charged with a Crime  MORE: Hunter Biden: Could Be Go to Jail?  A 19FortyFive Senior Editor, Brandon J.

        "text": "© Provided by Law & Crime Ketanji Brown Jackson  Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stood alone as an unwavering champion of labor unions and the right to strike Thursday, as she dissented from the Supreme Court’s 8-1 ruling against cement truck drivers who went on strike in 2017.  The case, Glacier Northwest, Inc. v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, was a dispute over the right of a concrete business to sue its unionized employees for damage caused to the company’s cement trucks after workers walked off the job. Glacier and its truck drivers –represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 174– were in a stalemate during contract negotiations when the drivers went on strike. The union says it instructed employees to leave the trucks’ cement drums spinning as they walked out so as to minimize damage to the vehicles. Glacier, however, says 16 trucks were damaged due to hardened cement — and that the costly result had been the result of intentional sabotage by its disgruntled workers.  Glacier sued Local 174 for the damage to the trucks, and Local 174 sued Glacier in a separate case alleging that it violated federal labor law by retaliating against union members for the strike.  Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a 12-page lead opinion for the court, which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Brett Kavanaugh. Barrett concluded simply that the union’s actions both destroyed Glacier’s concrete and “posed a risk of foreseeable, aggravated, and imminent harm to Glacier’s trucks.” Taken together, Barrett found these factors rendered the strike unprotected, thus exposing Local 174 to liability.  Jackson, though, was stalwart in her her support of workers’ right to strike.  “The right to strike is fundamental to American labor law,” began Jackson in her 27-page dissent. The justice went on to explain that Congress codified this right in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and protected it with the creation of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  Jackson chastised her fellow justices for “falter[ing]” by abandoning a half-century of precedent “scrupulously guard[ing]” the authority of the NLRB.  The Joe Biden appointee berated her peers for “try[ing] its own hand” at interpreting NLRB precedent and making related factual determinations that will lead to chaotic consequences.  “And in the course of inappropriately weighing in on the merits of those questions at this stage, the majority also misapplies the Board’s cases in a manner that threatens to both impede the Board’s uniform development of labor law and erode the right to strike,” Jackson warned. That danger was precisely the reason Congress created the NLRB, said Jackson, articulating an argument whose parallel might well be applied to other federal agencies in response to the current Court’s hostility toward the “administrative state.”  Jackson argued that the NLRA’s primary purpose was to protect the rights of workers to strike and that sorting out “protected” versus “unprotected” activities during a strike “is a legally and factually complex task” reserved for the agency with specialized labor knowledge. When the Supreme Court took a crack at doing this work itself, said Jackson, it failed, because “the majority seems to misunderstand [the application of legal precedent] in the context of this case.”  Related Coverage:  Jackson schooled her fellow justices on the way the NLRA was meant to work. Costly damage as a result of a strike is nothing new, she argued. Rather, “Congress was well aware that organized labor’s exercise of the right to strike risks harm to an employer’s economic interests.”  Despite the potential for damage to an employer, “Congress protected that right anyway,” said Jackson.  “In fact, the threat of economic harm posed by the right to strike is a feature, not a bug, of the NLRA,” she wrote. “The potential pain of a work stoppage is a powerful tool, and one that unquestionably advances Congress’s codified goal of achieving ‘equality of bargaining power between employers and employees.'”  Jackson allowed that the right to strike, while central to the NLRA’s goal, is “not unlimited,” and gave examples of unannounced strikes in healthcare settings as an example. Jackson acknowledged that striking employees would not have legal protection if they took an “affirmative step to destroy or seize the employer’s property,” or if they failed to take “reasonable precautions” to avoid “imminent, aggravated injury,” but likened perishable concrete to spoiled milk or cheese — results that do not generally render a strike “unprotected.”  Jackson unequivocally found that, “There is also no duty to take reasonable precautions to prevent this kind of economic loss, which—standing alone—posed no risk to persons, premises, or equipment, let alone a risk of aggravated harm.”  Jackson called the fact that drivers could have “saved” the concrete by delivering it to the intended customers “beside the point.” Holding employees liable for incidental loss of perishable goods would undercut their right to strike in the first place. The majority, by contrast, focused on the damage to the trucks — as opposed to the damage to the hardening concrete; Jackson said such an analysis is “complex” and “nuanced,” and that the strike involved was at least “arguably” protected.  The justice refused to concede that striking while trucks were filled with wet concrete was an “aggravated” injury for Glacier. Rather, she said the drivers’ timing was “unremarkable.” As a concrete company, Glacier engages in a “risky business,” said Jackson, but that hardly creates “some obligation on the drivers to strike in the middle of the night or before the next day’s jobs had started.”  Jackson used a footnote to call out conservative Justice Samuel Alito for the hard line take articulated in his brief concurrence joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. Alito, rarely a friend to federal authority, said that states are within their rights to subject unionized workers to liability for intentionally destroy an employer’s property.  Justice Clarence Thomas also wrote a short concurrence which was joined by Gorsuch. In it, Thomas urged the Court to rethink the framework by which it analyzes conflicts between state law and the NLRA. While the applicable precedent did not need to be disturbed in the Glacier case, Thomas suggested the Court consider upending it in an “appropriate” case in the future.

Carroll, 79, said in an interview with NBC News' Savannah Guthrie on the \"TODAY\" show Wednesday morning that the court win was not about the millions she was awarded in damages but securing a victory for all women.  \"I am overwhelmed, overwhelmed with joy and happiness and delight for the women in this country,\" she said.  \"This is not about the money.

Trump, who is campaigning for the 2024 presidency, has consistently denied Carroll’s claims.  “I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHO THIS WOMAN IS. THIS VERDICT IS A DISGRACE — A CONTINUATION OF THE GREATEST WITCH HUNT OF ALL TIME!” he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, after the verdicts were handed down.  A Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement Tuesday: \"This case will be appealed, and we will ultimately win.\"  Asked what she would say to Trump if she could, Carroll said she approached his attorney, Joe Tacopina, at the conclusion of the case and let him know.  “Tacopina put out his hand and I said, ‘He did it and you know it.’ So I got my chance,” she recalled.  Carroll was alongside her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, who said she was confident that her client will collect the damages from Trump and that his team has no grounds for an appeal.  \"I’ve rarely felt more confident about an appeal as I do about this one,\" she said.  Kaplan said there was \"no question\" the jury was sending a message by awarding multimillion-dollar damages and reaching a verdict in a matter of hours.  She also said that Trump's decision not to testify had helped. \"He didn't even bother to show up,\" she added.  Trump’s deposition, in which he was asked about the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that surfaced before the 2016 presidential election, also helped secure the victory, Kaplan said.  Asked during the deposition about his remarks in the tape, Trump said, “Well, historically, that’s true with stars.”  “True with stars that they can grab women” by their privates? Kaplan asked.  “Well, that’s what — if you look over the last million years, I guess that’s been largely true. Not always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately,” Trump responded.  Kaplan said in her interview on “TODAY” that this was an important moment. “Fortunately? Who uses the word fortunately to talk about sexual assault?” she asked.  Carroll also spoke of the toll the case has taken on her during more than 30 years.  “Before yesterday, there was a concept of the perfect victim, who always screams, always reports to the police, always makes notes of when it happened, and their life folds up and they’re never supposed to be happy,” she said.  “Yesterday we demolished that concept, it is gone. It’s not so much about me, it’s about every woman.”  As for Trump's repeated claim that he has no idea who she is, a delighted Carroll noted that among the many legal issues the former president may face: \"What happened yesterday is one ... little blond, wily, female attorney and one 79-year-old advice columnist beat Donald Trump in court.\"  Several Republican senators have warned that Tuesday's verdict could hurt Trump's chances of re-election. The verdict marks the first time a former president has been found liable for sexual misconduct in a civil case.  The outcome of the civil case has no criminal implications. The standard of evidence needed to prove liability — on the preponderance of evidence — was lower than that of a criminal trial, in which a case must be proven beyond all reasonable doubt.  Carroll sued in Manhattan federal court last year, alleging Trump raped her in the dressing room of a Bergdorf Goodman department store near his Fifth Avenue home in 1995 or 1996. She first went public with the claim in 2019 in her book “What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal.”  Trump, first as president and then as a private citizen, called Carroll’s account a fiction that she concocted to boost book sales, and he has said she is “not my type.” He didn’t testify at the trial, but parts of his video deposition from October were played for the jury.  The verdict was required to be unanimous. It was issued Tuesday after the jury deliberated for only about three hours.  Asked on its verdict sheet whether Carroll had proven “by a preponderance of the evidence” that “Mr. Trump raped Ms. Carroll,” the jury of six men and three women checked the box that said “no.”  Asked whether Carroll had proven “by a preponderance of the evidence” that “Mr. Trump sexually abused Ms. Carroll,” the jury checked the box that said “yes.” Both allegations were elements of Carroll’s battery claim.  The jury also found that Trump had defamed Carroll by calling her claims a “hoax” and a “con job.” Carroll was awarded just more than $2 million on the battery claim and just under $3 million on the defamation claims. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nE.

        "text": "© Zach Wilkinson/Pool/Getty Images Bryan Kohberger enters the courtroom for his arraignment hearing in Latah County District Court, May 22, 2023 in Moscow, Idaho. Bryan Kohberger, the suspect in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students, is likely \"a really difficult client,\" according to a defense attorney. Kohberger, 28, declined to enter pleas during his arraignment in Latah County District Court on Monday, with his defense attorney Anne Taylor telling the judge that they were going to \"stand silent\" at this time. The decision prompted 2nd District Judge John Judge to enter not guilty pleas on Kohberger's behalf. He is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one of burglary in connection with the November 13 slayings of Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20, at a rental home near the university campus in Moscow. Then a graduate student studying criminology at nearby Washington State University, Kohberger was arrested late last year at his parents' home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania. On Monday, Kohberger also declined to waive his right to a speedy trial, so the judge scheduled it to begin on October 2. Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson now has 60 days to inform the court whether he will seek the death penalty in the case. Discussing the arraignment, NewsNation's Ashleigh Banfield said on her show on Monday night that she had \"never seen somebody look so engaged… and then stop talking.\" Criminal defense attorney Richard Blok told Banfield that it \"seems really strange\" if Kohberger is trying to \"work up an incompetency defense.\" \"This is not a good way to do it,\" Blok said. He suggested Taylor could struggle in getting Kohberger to do what needs to be done to present a good defense in the case. \"I think more than likely, Anne Taylor has got a really difficult client who's going to be a problem,\" Blok said. \"And she's gonna have a lot of trouble controlling him and getting him to do the things he needs to do to present a good defense.\" Jessica Bublitz, another criminal defense attorney, said on NewsNation that many attorneys in Idaho believe standing silent in response to a grand jury indictment gives an advantage when it comes to challenging that indictment. Kohberger was indicted last week by a grand jury. \"I don't personally think that it would make a difference, but my impression is that this is likely just Anne Taylor's method, par for the course for her, when she has a client in the situation where they're going to be potentially challenging a grand jury indictment,\" Bublitz said. \"She stands silent as opposed to entering that not guilty plea.\" The decision to stand silent also raised questions about whether Kohberger was trying to avoid facing the death penalty. Sara Azari, a criminal defense attorney, has said that standing mute is a \"smart\" strategy to appease the families of the victims. \"We say silence is golden ... [It's about] leaving the door open so that if this is a really bad case in terms of irrefutable evidence and he does in fact, ultimately, plead guilty in exchange for the death penalty to come off or what not, that he's not now p****d off four hurting, reeling families,\" she said.

        "text": "Newly minted GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis promises to “Make America Florida.” To me, that sounds more like a threat than a campaign slogan, but I suppose it depends on how you like your democracy: plain or with a side of fascism.  The Florida governor made his formal presidential campaign announcement in the weirdest way possible, joining a Wednesday evening Twitter Spaces conversation with Twitter CEO and noted conspiracy-theorist-coddler Elon Musk. The event was moderated by David Sacks, a wealthy GOP donor who is pals with Musk and supports DeSantis, creating a turducken of wealth, confirmation-bias and “very online” social awkwardness. There were also spectacular technical glitches, again raising questions of whether the governor is truly ready for a national campaign.  But don’t let the spectacle of DeSantis’ entry into the GOP primary distract you from what “Make America Florida” might actually mean. The governor has implemented a far-right, culture-war-heavy agenda in the Sunshine State and ruled like a power-hungry autocrat, bolstered by a Republican-controlled legislature. He views diversity as a societal ill, and seems focused only on making the world better only for people who share his values. But don't take my word for it. Just look at the things he has done.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  Ron DeSantis has done a lot in Florida – and a lot of it should scare voters  For many Americans, folks lucky enough to not spend their days drinking from the fire hose of 24-hour political news, DeSantis remains an abstraction. He has been controversial among liberals and hailed as a hero among conservatives. A recent poll by the progressive think tank Data For Progress found about a third of likely voters view him unfavorably and a third view him favorably. But, important, nearly a third of likely voters “haven’t heard enough to say” whether they like or dislike him, and among independents that number jumps to 36%.  © Charlie Neibergall, AP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to announce his 2024 presidential campaign in a Twitter Spaces event with Elon Musk on May 24, 2023.  So now that DeSantis is in the running for a presidential nomination, voters are going to have to understand him, and that requires looking at what he has done in (and to) Florida and asking: Is this a palatable model for the rest of America, and is this the kind of person I’d want in charge?  The now-infamous 'Don't Say Gay' law is causing widespread confusion  Let’s start with the Parental Rights in Education law, which critics have aptly dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” law. The original bill barred Florida teachers in kindergarten through third grade from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity. It was then expanded so it covered students through eighth grade and then, in April, it became a complete K-12 ban, which was presumably the goal from the jump.  © Jon Cherry/Getty Images Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' education policy spans detailed reviews of classroom reading materials and restrictions on how sexuality and race can be discussed with students.  Teachers who violate the vaguely worded ban could lose their teaching licenses, and the law has created widespread confusion, leading to the banning of seemingly innocuous children’s books that mention LGBTQ issues. The law also said a teacher “may not provide to a student his or her preferred personal title or pronouns if such preferred personal title or pronouns do not correspond to his or her sex.”  A childish and self-destructive war with Disney  Disney, one of Florida’s largest employers and tourist magnets, voiced gentle disagreement with the “Don’t Say Gay” law, prompting DeSantis to launch a crusade against the company, dubbing it “woke.” Disney has now sued the governor for “a targeted campaign of government retaliation,” and recently pulled out of a planned $1 billion development near Orlando that would’ve brought 2,000 high-paying jobs to the state.  Game on. With DeSantis making it official on Twitter, the fight against Trump can begin.  That mess ties in nicely with DeSantis’ borderline fanatical “war on woke,” in which he has staked out firm opposition to things like diversity, LGBTQ rights and pretty much anything that might make straight white people mildly uncomfortable.  Drag show bans and DEI defunding and pronoun policing – oh my  His “accomplishments” on that front include:  Signing a bill that bars Florida universities and colleges from using any state or federal money to fund programs that “advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion.”  Signing an anti-drag-show bill that, again, is worded so vaguely that it may impact pride parades and other public LBGTQ celebrations.  © Daniel A. Varela, AP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis addresses the crowd before publicly signing the Stop WOKE Act in April 2022.  Signing the Stop WOKE Act, which, among other things, prohibits businesses from diversity training or practices that might make an employee feel guilty or responsible for historic wrongs relating to race, sex or national origin. It effectively undercuts any steps a company might take to help employees of different backgrounds understand and appreciate each other. A federal judge has blocked the law, ruling it unconstitutional.  Blocking an AP African American history class from being taught in Florida schools.  But wait ... there's more ...  DeSantis has also: rounded up migrants in Texas and flown them to Massachusetts' Martha’s Vineyard at Florida taxpayers’ expense in one of the more cruel anti-immigrant stunts ever concocted; created an election police unit called the Office of Election Crimes and Security, best known for arresting 20 mostly Black voters and accomplishing nothing other than messing up those voters’ lives; signed a six-week abortion ban; and signed a law allowing people to carry a concealed gun without training or a permit.  Much is made about Florida’s strong economy and the fact that people and companies have flocked there because there’s no income tax for individuals and the state has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in nation.  But lower taxes mean less money for other things. Florida ranks 42nd in the country for spending on public education, according to the Education Data Initiative, even though it received the third-most federal education funding for K-12 schools.  DeSantis' high-profile 'war on woke' distracts from Florida's struggles  In the 2020-21 school year, Florida ranked 48th in the country for teacher salaries, according to the National Education Association.  In Education Week’s state-by-state 2021 chance-for-success Index, Florida ranked No. 32.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Florida ranks near the bottom in terms of uninsured residents, with 12.1% of Floridians uncovered. Only four states are worse.  And AARP’s 2020 Scorecard Report on long-term services and supports for older adults and people with physical disabilities ranked Florida dead last.  One parent fears a poem, and in DeSantis' Florida, that means the poem is gone  Don’t take my word for these things. Read the included links. Do your own research and see how DeSantis’ priorities and approach to government aligns with your own values.  But I’ll leave with one final development. In Miami-Dade County recently, a parent filed a complaint about a book that contains the poem “The Hill We Climb,” written by Amanda Gorman and recited at President Joe Biden’s inauguration.  © Courtesy photo Amanda Gorman recited her poem “The Hill We Climb” at the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, 2021.  On the complaint, the parent wrote – and this transcription is correct – that the book is “not educational and have indirectly hate messages.”  This is what’s on one of the offending pages the parent referenced:  “We've braved the belly of the beast.We’ve learned that quiet isn’t always peace,And the norms and notions of what ‘just’ isIsn’t always justice.”  Those words count as “hate messages” in Ron DeSantis’ Florida. And students in that county's kindergarten through eighth grade are now barred from seeing that book.

        "text": "© Provided by Benzinga The debt ceiling stalemate continues as Republican lawmakers walked off the discussion table on Friday only to join back in the evening. President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have warned of serious consequences if a debt deal is not reached. Against the backdrop, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers weighed in on the wrangling between the Republican and Democratic parties. What Happened: \"I wish it hadn't happened, but I'm not surprised,\" Summers said in an interview with CNN, referring to the temporary pause in talks. \"There is always posturing in these talks and walking out … is a kind of posturing,\" he said. Trending: If You Invested $1,000 In Amazon Stock At IPO 26 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - Amazon.com ( Must Read: Analyst Warns Bitcoin And Other Crypto Assets Could Crash If This Happens: 'It Might Make A New Low' For both sides of the aisle, there appears to be a need from each side to feel like they negotiated as hard as they possibly could, and for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif), it is all the more important, Summers said. This is especially because of the \"fanatics\" that are in some parts of the caucus, he said. \"So, walking out of the talks at least once as leverage and bluster is probably part of the playbook,\" he said. Summers added that it is in the mutual interest of everybody — more importantly, in the massive interest of the country — to reach a deal so that some kind of experimentation of what a default could look like wouldn’t need to be implemented. See Also: Best Depression Stocks 14th Amendment Not Viable Solution: Summers also suggested that Biden invoking the 14th Amendment, which allows the country to keep paying off debts without Congressional approval, is not a viable solution. \"The very substantial majority of legal opinion is that this would be a highly problematic course,\" the former treasury secretary said. People would also know that it would be open to challenge in the courts, he said. \"I think under those circumstances, everything about the finances of the United States would come under a cloud. So I think that would not be the right tactic,\" Summers said, noting that the debt ceiling impasse should be worked through a normal process. When Will A Resolution Come? In order to scare both sides into reaching a solution, \"we need to get closer to the brink,\" Summers said. \"There needs to be a broader understanding of that that we are past a certain point … you really are doing a real damage to the country and you can't buy more time,\" he said.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers weighed in on the debt ceiling stalemate between the Republican and Democratic parties, saying that posturing and walking out of talks is part of the playbook.\nHe also suggested that President Biden invoking the 14th Amendment is not a viable solution and that both sides need to get closer to the brink in order to reach a resolution.\nSummers believes that if a deal is not reached, it could lead to serious consequences for the country.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers weighed in on the debt ceiling stalemate between the Republican and Democratic parties.\nSummers suggested that President Biden invoking the 14th Amendment is not a viable solution.\nIn order to scare both sides into reaching a solution, \"we need to get closer to the brink,\" Summers said.\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned of serious consequences if a debt deal is not reached."

        "text": "© J. Scott Applewhite J. Scott Applewhite The Senate approved a House-passed bill to raise the debt ceiling late Thursday, sailing through votes that were expected to last deep into the night and cementing the notion that government can still function – or flourish – under the most pressing of circumstances. In a 63-36 vote, the Senate approved the measure, which now heads to the desk of President Joe Biden for his signature, successfully averting default just days ahead of the deadline. Despite largely staying out of the debt limit talks while House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Biden took the helm, lawmakers seemed to play catch-up on Thursday, as some took issue with the bill’s defense spending levels, while others opposed portions of the legislation related to the environment and new work restrictions for some federal aid programs. Nevertheless, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the chamber would proceed to votes on amendments, and then final passage on Thursday evening, pledging to stick around until they got things done. “I am pleased, so pleased, to announce that both sides have just locked in an agreement that enables the Senate to pass legislation tonight avoiding default,” Schumer said. “For all the ups and downs and twists and turns it took to get here, it is so good for this country that both parties have come together at last to avoid default.” Complicating the effort was the need for unanimous consent to expedite the bill’s path forward, giving a single senator the ability to set back the legislation’s trajectory by a number of days, as the upper chamber had very little room for error ahead of a default expected as soon as Monday. Accordingly, leaders were working to secure an agreement, with lawmakers skittering back and forth on the Senate floor and between offices for hours on Thursday. Some of the most vocal opposition on Thursday was from a group of Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who opposed the levels of defense spending in the legislation. Early Thursday, Graham threatened to hold up the chamber into next week unless he could get a commitment to “rectify” some of his issues with defense spending, among other grievances. “To my House colleagues: I can’t believe you did this,” Graham said. “To the Speaker, I know you got a tough job, I like you, but the party of Ronald Reagan is dying.” But by the evening, Graham suggested that he had secured a commitment from Schumer to address defense spending later on. The chamber voted on 11 amendments Thursday night. But each was ultimately quashed, as leaders made clear that there was no time to send the legislation back to the House with changes, saying it would all but guarantee default. Though the bulk of the proposed amendments came from Republicans, some Democrats have also taken issue with components of the bill, including Sen. Tim Kaine. The Virginia Democrat opposed a portion of the legislation that would streamline the permitting process for energy projects, greenlighting the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia. He introduced an amendment on Thursday that would remove that provision. Like the other amendments, it failed. A couple of progressives also opposed the legislation, including independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, pointing to the permitting and work requirement provisions, among other issues. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon also voted against the measure. Schumer made clear Thursday morning that “time is a luxury the Senate does not have,” urging lawmakers to avoid any “needless delay or any last-minute hold ups.” The day did not come without its hang-ups. Still, lawmakers appeared eager to leave town on Friday, burning through the votes with close to record speed Thursday night.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill Former Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) stood by his 2016 decision to deny Merrick Garland a confirmation hearing to become a Supreme Court justice, calling the potential for holding one at the time “a mistake for him and for the country.” “I think so,” Blunt told Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet The Press” when asked whether denying Garland a hearing was the right decision. Blunt argued the nomination was certain to fail. “You could argue maybe we should have had a hearing. I think the way these hearings go, that would in many ways have been unfair to him, to put him through a hearing, to not be approved. I actually supported the majority leader’s decision at the time and still think in the politics of the country and the way these confirmations have happened, when you have the majority, and the president’s from the other party, there’s just a long history of not filling an election-year vacancy,” Blunt said. According to the Brookings Institution, no such history exists; Supreme Court vacancies have been filled in election years by unified and divided governments. Garland, now the U.S. attorney general, was nominated in March 2016 by President Obama to fill the vacancy of former Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February of that year. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) denied him a confirmation hearing, citing the fact that it was an election year. Many criticized McConnell for then deciding to allow a confirmation hearing for Amy Coney Barrett, who was nominated by Trump in late September 2020, also an election year, and confirmed in late October. Blunt said the lack of a hearing for Garland was a topic he heard more about than any other during his time in office. “I will say in that year, I had more people at the airport and other places mention that single thing to me than I’ve ever had of any other thing. ‘Why don’t you give Garland a hearing?’ And I think I probably gave them the same answer I just gave you. ‘He won’t be confirmed. Having a hearing would be a mistake for him and for the country,’” Blunt said. Regarding Barrett’s confirmation, Blunt argued voters would have taken their frustration out at the polls had Republicans not confirmed her when they had the chance. “But I get it. Now, the difference, of course, the next year before a presidential change is that the president’s party has the majority. And that’s a different circumstance in a substantial way. If you don’t do that, let’s say you don’t do that, two months before the election, you’ve always got the sense that your side will just collapse on Election Day because they wonder why they sent you there if you could’ve done this and didn’t,” Blunt said. “And so that’s, that’s a big difference.”<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFormer Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) defended his decision to deny Merrick Garland a confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court in 2016. \nBlunt argued that having a hearing would have been unfair to Garland and that there is no history of not filling an election-year vacancy. \nRepublicans faced the potential of their side collapsing on Election Day if they did not confirm Amy Coney Barrett in 2020. \nBlunt argued that this was a substantial difference from the situation with Garland in 2016.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFormer Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) defended his decision to deny Merrick Garland a confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court in 2016, arguing that it would have been unfair to him and that there was a long history of not filling an election-year vacancy.\nBlunt also discussed the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in 2020, saying that if Republicans had not confirmed her, voters would have taken their frustration out at the polls.\nHe argued that the difference between the two situations was that the president's party had the majority in 2020."

        "text": "Four days before part of an Iowa apartment building collapsed, an engineering firm warned that it appeared at risk of crumbling. Select Structural Engineering said in a letter dated May 24 that large patches of brick “appear ready to fall imminently” and laid out repair recommendations “to keep the entire face of the building from falling away when the bottoms area(s) come loose.” The engineers also warned that “the brick façade is unlikely to be preserved in place, but it can be brought down in a safe, controlled manner.” City officials said Thursday that they didn’t order residents to vacate because they relied on the engineering team's assurances that the building was safe. The 116-year-old building in Davenport partly collapsed over the weekend, and three people are still unaccounted for, police said Thursday. They were identified as Branden Colvin, Ryan Hitchcock and Daniel Prien, 60. Police said this week that five people were unaccounted for, but two of them have been located: One moved out a month ago and was in Texas, and the other was in Davenport. Davenport Police Chief Jeffery Bladel said that there is a \"high probability\" the three missing people were home when part of the building caved in and that they are in \"that collapsed space.\" \"All the information provided to us is that space is not sustainable to life,\" he said. Mayor Mike Matson said there's no timeline for demolition as officials work with experts to find a way to safely demolish the building while acknowledging it as a \"resting place.\" © Provided by NBC News Police continue to secure a six-story apartment building on May 29, 2023, in Davenport, Iowa, after it collapsed the day before. (Scott Olson / Getty Images) Ryan Shaffer, who co-owns RA Masonry, said he repeatedly warned construction workers at that building, as well as the building’s owner, about the dangers there. RA Masonry put in a bid to do work at the building, and it was rejected, Shaffer said, but he kept up with the project. He said he warned workers there Saturday, a day before it fully collapsed, after he saw that interior layers of bricks — not just outer bricks — had been falling. “That’s the main structure of the building. If that falls, it’s going,” Shaffer said. “On Saturday is when I addressed the workers — I said, ‘You need to leave. It’s going to fall.’” Documents reveal city interacted with building and owner over 100 times in past 3 years The city released a cache of documents and permits Wednesday evening showing a history of tenant complaints and issues plaguing 324 Main St. Asked by reporters at a news conference Thursday why the building wasn't shut down despite myriad problems, city officials said that the collapse is \"a new thing for our city\" and that they trusted a report in May from an engineering firm hired by the property owner, which deemed the structure safe. Here are most damning revelations in the released documents: There were 145 interactions between the city and the property and its owner, Andrew Wold, from 2020 to 2023. The interactions included inspections and documented tenant complaints from water coming through ceilings to faulty plumbing to no heat for months to overflowing garbage to worsening cracks in walls. Five “notice to vacate letters” were issued to different apartment units from 2020 to 2023 because of “substandard conditions” and after multiple inspections found issues hadn’t been fixed. Fire Marshal Jim Morris said in a letter dated March 13 that an inspection had found several fire hazard issues, including faulty emergency lights, fire doors that didn’t function properly and outdated smoke detectors. The letter said, “The lack of responsiveness with this property is unacceptable.” There were also multiple notices that city code inspectors were unable to access the building. The building was declared a nuisance in May 2022 because of several solid waste violations. Wold was ordered to pay a $4,500 penalty after he failed to appear in court, The Associated Press reported. A city notice dated Feb. 2 said a field inspection showed issues that needed immediate attention. It said that “part of the south-west wall has been gradually failing,” adding, “There is visible crumbling of this exterior load bearing wall under the support beam.” It also said exterior brick veneer had separated, which allowed rain and ice to build up and cause “further damage.” It said that “emergency vacate orders will be posted on the building if the failing masonry area is not secured per this letter.” © Erin Hooley Clothing hanging in an apartment of the building that partially collapsed. (Erin Hooley / AP) Property owner cited A citation was filed against Wold on Tuesday in Scott County Court for failing to maintain the building in a safe and sanitary condition. The city asked for a $300 fine plus court fees. “The city of Davenport requests that the Court order the defendant from committing any further violations of the city code provisions,” the citation said. City Attorney Tom Warner said the citation was filed to prevent Wold from transferring the property to avoid the demolition order. A court date is set for June 9. There have been outrage and frustration with the city’s handling of the building and the aftermath of the collapse. Former and recent tenants of the historic apartment building said they had complained to management for years about cracks in the walls, plumbing woes and a lack of heat and air conditioning — but were consistently ignored. Asked Thursday whether the city should have vacated the building to prevent such a disaster, Matson, the mayor, simply said: “I have the same anger and concern.” Wold, who bought the property in June 2021, issued his first public comment since the collapse Tuesday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with our tenants and families during this difficult time,” said a statement signed by Wold and the Village Property Management team. “We have been working closely with the American Red Cross and other agencies to assist the displaced tenants affected by this event. We are forever grateful to them for all of their assistance with our tenants,” the brief statement said.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe 116-year-old building in Davenport, Iowa, partially collapsed over the weekend, leaving three people unaccounted for.\nDocuments reveal that the city interacted with the building and its owner over 100 times in the past three years due to tenant complaints and issues.\nAn engineering firm warned four days before the collapse that the building appeared at risk of crumbling, but city officials did not order residents to vacate.\nThe property owner has been cited for failing to maintain the building in a safe and sanitary condition.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nAn engineering firm warned four days before part of an Iowa apartment building collapsed that it appeared at risk of crumbling. \nThree people are still unaccounted for after the building partly collapsed over the weekend. \nThe city had 145 interactions with the building and its owner in the past three years, including multiple notices to vacate and warnings of fire hazards. \nThe property owner was cited for failing to maintain the building in a safe and sanitary condition."

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  “Reparations: the act of making amends, offering expiation, or giving satisfaction for a wrong or injury.”  That’s the official definition of reparations in the Merriam Webster Dictionary. And in California, officially a “free state” during the era of slavery, a reparations task force just approved recommendations that could give each Black resident $1.2 million as compensation for slavery and other injustices. If this becomes law, it will cost the state of California an estimated $800 billion.  The reparations debate tends to fall along ideological and racial lines. According to Pew Research Center, reparations are supported by nearly half of Democrats but just 8 percent of Republicans. Overall, more than two-thirds (68 percent) of Americans oppose reparations. But that isn’t preventing San Francisco from attempting to forge ahead with its budget-busting plan.  Given the amount of money being discussed, surely the city’s African American Reparations Advisory Committee put a lot of time and energy into devising and applying some kind of mathematical formula to land at $1.2 million-per-person, right?  “There wasn’t a math formula,” confessed the committee’s chairman, Eric McDonnell.  “It was a journey for the committee towards what could represent a significant enough investment in families to put them on this path to economic well-being, growth and vitality that chattel slavery, and all the policies that flowed from it destroyed.”  So… just throw a seven-digit number out there and see if it sticks. Got it.  Easy question here: Where exactly is all this money going to come from? Because at last check, San Francisco is facing a $728 million budget shortfall over the next two fiscal years.  As is always the case, the Democratic solution is simply to impose another tax on the rich. “The rich must pay their fair share” is the mantra when it comes to justifying more spending. But the top 1 percent of income earners made nearly 21 percent of all income but paid 40 percent of all federal income taxes. So, it appears they’re already paying more than their fair share.  But with high-income earners fleeing the Golden State, tax revenue continues to be depleted. Per Bloomberg News:  “San Francisco, suffering from some of the nation’s weakest office occupancies and stubbornly low transit ridership, is now expecting business taxes over the next two years to decline by $179.3 million from previous estimates. Significantly, property taxes — usually a stable revenue source in downturns — are now projected over the same period to drop by $261 million from the earlier forecast.”  To complicate matters further, San Francisco is seeing the largest exodus of citizens of any city in the country. In other words, there’s no tax revenue to save the day. Which brings us back to our original question: Where is $800 billion coming from to pay for this?  California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) surely knows the math doesn’t remotely work. of course, Newsom established the reparation task force in 2020. But he now seems to be rejecting their recommendation for $1.2 million per person.  “Dealing with the legacy of slavery is about much more than cash payments,” Newsom said in his statement.  In other words, California simply doesn’t have the money.  In addition, according to the Wall Street Journal, “The California Legislative Office estimates tax revenue during this fiscal year and the next will likely be $10 billion lower, and the budget gap will likely be about $7 billion larger than the Governor forecasted last month, assuming Democrats restrain spending.”  America’s first Black president once weighed in on reparations. In 2004, he said, “I fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say, ‘We’ve paid our debt,’ and to avoid the much harder work.”  And in 2008, he said: “I have said in the past — and I’ll repeat again — that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed. These challenges will not go away with reparations. So, while I applaud and agree with the underlying sentiment of recognizing the continued legacy of slavery, I would prefer to focus on the issues that will directly address these problems — and building a consensus to do just that.”  Hard to argue with that perspective. But somewhere along the way, Obama changed his tune.  “Are reparations justified? The answer is yes,” Obama said in 2021. Tellingly, however, Obama didn’t attempt to explain the math behind it.  This is where we are in 2023: Student loans are being forgiven for well-off college graduates, but there’s no loan forgiveness for those working hard and struggling to pay off a mortgage or car payment.  Same goes for reparations, where the thinking seems to be to hand out cash rather than, as Obama once recommended, do the “much harder work” of investing in the institutions that could actually help more Black Americans succeed.

        "text": "My little boy, who is not quite 9, would like to go to a professional football game here in Britain where we live. I have often felt an overwhelming sense of community when sitting in the stands at football tournaments.  But I’m reluctant to take my son along. I can’t help but worry about the attitudes he might encounter there toward people of color like us. That’s because the “beautiful game” we both love has a shameful racism problem.  © Provided by CNN Keith Magee - Arron Dunworth  The problem is in the spotlight yet again following the vile abuse directed at Black Brazilian Vinícius Júnior during a match between his team Real Madrid and Valencia.  The resulting scandal has rocked Spain, which has a history of racists targeting players, but the country is not alone — across Europe football has long been plagued by racism.  In recent years, racist abuse at matches has been getting worse, a phenomenon many see as being intrinsically tied to the rise of nationalism in Europe. Some of the nastiest incidents have occurred in Italy and other countries with a strong far-right presence and where xenophobic discourse has become normalized. In the UK, players have pointed out that comments made by politicians responsible for pushing an increasingly strident anti-immigrant stance have emboldened racists at matches.  It is proving difficult to dislodge racism from British football, despite attempts at structural reform (with mixed results), the introduction of tougher deterrents and the outstanding efforts of anti-racist organizations such as Kick It Out. A 2021 survey found a third of ethnic minority football fans had experienced racism at stadiums, and in England and Wales, race-related hate crimes at matches are on the rise.  Football is, of course, a reflection of society. Like any sport, it can mirror humanity’s ugliest traits, such as hate-driven tribalism, as well its best ones, such as tolerance and compassion.  But the sport is also a uniquely powerful force with a potentially critical role to play in the global fight for racial justice. What happens at matches matters, because racist incidents and their repercussions are witnessed by millions all over the world.  These games offer a window into how other regions, nations or continents deal with difference, and provide a rare opportunity for us to think as an international community about what kind of society we want to live in.  When football reflects the worst of us, as it did in Spain, it elicits condemnation from at least one president as well as from the United Nations. Tournaments and sponsorship deals worth billions of dollars are jeopardized, and — most importantly — children who kick balls around in the local park notice and learn from our responses.  Sadly, it often takes a major scandal to spark outrage and accelerate the pace of change. When fans, sponsors, managers and football authorities are united in indignation, as most are right now, it is imperative that they seize the moment to transform attitudes within the sport and beyond.  Anti-racism slogans, however, are no longer enough. Governing bodies like FIFA and UEFA should stop using racism’s reach outside the sport as an excuse for inadequate responses. Europe’s football authorities must send a clear message that they will not tolerate hate by introducing more stringent sanctions.  Clubs whose fans or players commit hate crimes should have points deducted, impacting their position in their league. For national teams, racist behavior by fans or players should result in a tournament ban. The ultimate goal of ridding the game of racism justifies the means.  In Spain, where racist incidents are largely dealt with by the courts, La Liga is now calling for its own sanctioning powers. I hope it makes full use of them to punish racism swiftly and decisively.  Truly effective anti-racism measures tend to be put in place when individuals who know what discrimination feels like hold positions of influence. While diversity among football players is high, representation off the pitch is shockingly poor at every level.  The example should come from the top, but progress is proving painfully slow. Since 2019, the diversity of UEFA’s Executive Committee has slightly improved (it now has two non-white members rather than just one), but the lack of Black or brown managers is still an issue across Europe. Perhaps the fact that Spain’s La Liga does not currently have a single non-white executive board member or manager or explains why it has failed, until now, to treat racism as a significant problem.  Education is also key. With its vast audiences and long seasons, football is the perfect vehicle via which to champion the extraordinary potential of teamwork. In every walk of life, if we collaborate to achieve racial justice, we can win much more than a mere tournament.  In the UK, inspirational organizations such as Show Racism the Red Card are spreading this message in schools and workplaces. But they should not bear this burden alone — governments must take responsibility for anti-racism education and training and make use of the unique platform football offers.  It will take time and effort to fully dismantle systemic racism, be it in football or in society, but it is possible. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, “ … the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” We all need to recognize racism when we see it and call it out. As my friend Shaka Hislop, president of Show Racism the Red Card, noted, “This mistreatment of Vinícius Júnior has only gone global because he refused to be silent.”  Every racist incident that occurs in a school hallway, a workplace, or on the street is just as serious as one that is broadcast live from a stadium into millions of homes. We must collectively make it impossible to turn away from inequality.  Black and brown footballers have often described being celebrated when they score, but othered and rejected when they don’t. When Mesut Özil, whose family origins are Turkish, quit the German national team in 2018, he wrote, “I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose.”  How many people like me, living in majority White nations, have also felt our darker skin color is “acceptable” only when we are perceived to be adding value?  Race will continue to divide us until we learn to see past our differences and cherish each other’s humanity whatever the circumstances. Taking this leap of empathy can be challenging.  For some people, the sight of a brilliant young footballer reduced to tears on the pitch by racist abuse might be what it takes for them to begin to understand the terrible harm such attacks cause.  To anyone, football fan or not, moved by Vinícius Júnior’s frustration and despair, I would say this: If you wouldn’t want one of your loved ones to feel that way, maybe it is time to act. Let’s ensure hate is on the losing side. The children are watching.

        "text": "© Provided by The Daily Beast REUTERS/Brian Snyder  MANCHESTER, NH—When Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley stepped onstage Wednesday morning at a campaign event in New Hampshire, she had a question for the crowd.  \"Everybody know about Dylan Mulvaney?” Haley asked. “Bud Light? That is a guy, dressed as a girl, making fun of women.”  To the GOP’s hardcore base, Dylan Mulvaney needs no introduction. The transgender content creator who partnered with Budweiser has been the target of vicious attacks and sustained indignation for weeks, largely thanks to a seemingly endless stream of segments on Fox News.  But in the crowd at Saint Anselm College’s “Politics & Eggs” event, packed with New Hampshire’s famously independent voters, this anti-transgender broadside was not met with applause but silence.  Voters in the room appeared largely unaware of the Bud Light controversy. When Haley waited for applause, they didn’t clap.  It wasn’t the only moment during Haley’s stop at the seminal New Hampshire campaign event when her conservative culture war messaging seemed out of place.  Earlier in her stump speech, for instance, Haley declared she was “unapologetically pro-life,” a staple GOP applause line that received a muted response from the crowd.  It distilled a key challenge for the former South Carolina governor, who wants to appeal to Republicans and independents turned off by Donald Trump but is leveraging other issues, like abortion and all things “woke,” to maintain her credibility with the party base.  Still, Haley’s positioning made news on Wednesday. When asked by a younger voter directly if she would support a national abortion ban, Haley did not specify a specific restriction—like ending abortions at six weeks or 15 weeks—but said she would sign it if it reached her desk.  Given the virtually non-existent chance the GOP would command 60 votes for an abortion ban anytime soon, Haley’s answer was largely theoretical, something she herself acknowledged.  “We have maybe 45 pro-life senators,” Haley said, speculating that only “one or two” more might join the ranks after the 2024 election.  Even so, Haley’s answer was more than many of her GOP presidential rivals have been willing to provide on the issue. Other contenders, like Trump, have given elusive answers in similar settings; Trump has openly said that backlash to the Dobbs decision last year hurt the GOP in the 2022 midterm elections.  Haley seemed to allude to those politics—and the dissonance of her message in this independent-leaning state—when she said she “can't suddenly change my pro-life decision because I'm campaigning in New Hampshire.”  “Can’t we all agree that we don’t want to see late term abortions?” she said at another point. “Can’t we agree there should be more access to contraception?”  To close out her answer, Haley said more reporters should ask President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris if they’re in favor of abortions at 36 weeks of pregnancy.  But when it comes to her own red lines, Haley said a precise number of weeks for a national ban is merely a distraction.  “No one has been honest with you,” said Haley, “about what the real debate is.” <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nNikki Haley received a muted response when she asked a crowd in New Hampshire about Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender content creator who partnered with Budweiser.\nHaley declared she was \"unapologetically pro-life\" and said she would sign a national abortion ban if it reached her desk.\nHaley suggested that more reporters should ask President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris if they're in favor of abortions at 36 weeks of pregnancy.\nHaley said that the debate over a national abortion ban should not focus on a specific number of weeks.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\n Nikki Haley, a Republican presidential candidate, visited New Hampshire and made a speech that included anti-transgender and pro-life messages.\nHer comments were met with silence from the crowd, which was largely unaware of the Bud Light controversy.\nHaley said she would sign a national abortion ban if it reached her desk, but noted that it was unlikely to pass in the near future.\nShe argued that the debate should not be focused on a specific number of weeks for a ban, but rather on the issue of late-term abortions."

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he will vote against the bill that President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) agreed upon to raise the debt ceiling and called on Biden to eliminate the ceiling himself through the 14th Amendment.  While he remains opposed to the bill, Sanders said in a statement Wednesday that the agreement could have been “much worse” and is a significant improvement from the Limit, Save, Grow Act that House Republicans passed in April. He said Republicans’ bill would have made major cuts to health care, education, childcare, nutrition assistance and other programs for the next decade, while the agreed upon bill would only make “modest” cuts for the next two years.  “Having said that, I cannot vote for this bill,” Sanders said.  The statement puts Sanders among the group of progressive Democrats who, like some conservative Republicans, have declared their opposition to the deal Biden and McCarthy made to raise the debt ceiling until January 2025. The legislation would also increase work requirements for certain individuals on federal public assistance programs, place a cap on nondefense spending to freeze it for 2024 and raise it by 1 percent in 2025 and make other spending cuts.  Sanders said he cannot “in good conscience” vote for a bill that would make affording the cost of childcare, health care and housing more difficult for working families while helping the wealthiest individuals and companies “cheat” on their taxes.  The bill would revoke $1.4 billion that had been allocated to the Internal Revenue Service through the Inflation Reduction Act last year, specifically to help the agency better enforce its rules on those not fully paying their share of taxes.  Sanders also criticized provisions of the bill that would advance the development of a major gas pipeline in West Virginia, increase military spending — where the U.S. already spends much more than other countries — and would end the federal moratorium on students repaying federal student loans that has been in place throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  “The fact of the matter is that this bill is totally unnecessary,” Sanders said. “The President has the authority and ability to eliminate the debt ceiling today by invoking the 14th Amendment. I look forward to the day when he exercises this authority and puts an end, once and for all, to the outrageous actions of this extreme right-wing to hold our entire economy hostage in order to get what they want.”  Some have raised the idea that Biden has the authority to invoke section four of the 14th Amendment, which states that the validity of the country’s debt “shall not be questioned,” to unilaterally raise the debt limit himself.  The White House shed doubt on the viability of the strategy last week, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying it would not “deal with the problem that we’re currently having at this moment.” <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nSenator Bernie Sanders has declared his opposition to the debt ceiling bill agreed upon by President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. \nThe bill would make modest cuts to certain programs for the next two years, and revoke $1.4 billion allocated to the IRS. \nSanders has called on Biden to eliminate the debt ceiling through the 14th Amendment. \nThe White House has expressed doubt on the viability of this strategy.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nSen.

Hannah Schoenbaum/AP  North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said on Monday that the state's education system is in a \"state of emergency.\"  Cooper said education in the state is \"under assault\" after GOP proposes changes to the curriculum.  One bill would prohibit schools from \"promoting certain concepts\" related to race and sex.  In response to a wave of \"extreme\" legislation proposed by Republicans in the state, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a \"state of emergency\" for its education system on Monday.  Cooper pointed out six bills now moving through the North Carolina legislature, two related to private school vouchers and four that would give politicians and parents more control over what material is allowed in school curriculums.  \"Public education powers our workforce, builds our businesses, and boosts our communities. Unfortunately, our public schools are under assault,\" Cooper said. \"The current General Assembly is considering extreme legislation that would cripple our public education system.\"  Conservatives across the country have pushed to remove books and other materials that they disagree with from schools over the past year. And in some states, like Wisconsin and Idaho, lawmakers have introduced laws that would strip teachers and librarians of their protections against penalties for distributing \"harmful\" material to minors.  In Florida, the state legislature passed the so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which prohibits the discussion of LGBTQ topics in classrooms. It also passed a law that forces teachers to pay union dues through mail-in checks.  Several similar bills have made their way through Congress as well, such as the Protect Childhood Innocence Act, introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene last year, which if passed would ban institutions of higher learning from \"providing instruction on gender-affirming care.\"  Cooper, a Democrat, declared the state of emergency during a press conference on Monday, asking North Carolinians to contact their state legislator to complain about the recently introduced bills.  One of the proposed laws would create a \"standard course advisory commission\" that would recommend curriculum standards for the state's schools, and a second bill that would prohibit schools from \"promoting certain concepts.\"  Among them is the concept that \"one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex.\" And another one is that \"an individual solely by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.\"  Another proposed law would amend the state constitution to allow State Board of Education members to be elected. Vacant seats would be filled by a governor's appointment but would need to be approved by the legislature under the proposed law.  In a news release, Cooper said that these new laws would force the State Board of Education into partisan elections and take its authority away.  \"Let education experts make curriculum decisions on what students learn,\" Cooper said.  Cooper also said that creating a voucher system to send kids to private schools without income limits would effectively allow millionaires to send their kids to private schools for free.  \"Stop private school vouchers with no income limits,\" Cooper said. \"It will rob public schools of needed funding and sanctions discrimination.

Donald Trump joined in the attacks, crafting a whole new conspiracy theory: \"Joe Biden's second bout of Covid, sometimes referred to as the China Virus, was sadly misdiagnosed by his doctors. He instead has Dementia, but is happily recovering well,\" Trump wrote. \"Joe is thinking of moving, part time, to one of those beautiful Wisconsin Nursing Homes, where almost 100% of the residents miraculously, and for the first time in history, had the strength and energy to vote — even if those votes were cast illegally.\"  For years, Trump called Biden \"sleepy Joe.\"  Stephen Miller said Biden should be in “assisted living” and “is not cognitively present.”  But it seems Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) isn't on message.  Asked about Biden, McCarthy said: \"I thought his team was very professional, very smart, very tough, at the same time, so....\" The fact that McCarthy said \"team\" threw reporters off.

        "text": "© Provided by The Guardian Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images  As you’ve probably noticed, the word “woke” has been entirely wrung of any meaning in recent years. BlackRock and Silicon Valley Bank are “woke”, according to the right. Walt Disney is woke. Pope Francis is woke. Even the US military industrial complex is woke.  The newest target? Miller Lite. Conservatives are hopping mad after discovering a two-month-old Miller Lite commercial that was released during Women’s History Month.  What exactly is the problem with this ad? Well, it seems that people are taking extreme offense to the fact that that the ad humorously points out that there is a long history of misogyny in beer advertising, including Miller’s own legacy of using women in skimpy bikinis to sell lager. Fully-clothed women drinking beer? Woke!  Ilana Glazer of Broad City fame stars in the commercial, which encourages people to send in sexist beer ads so Miller Lite, which is owned by Molson Coors, can turn them into fertilizer. That fertilizer is then donated to female brewers who (bear with me here) use it to grow hops for beer. The whole initiative is called the “Bad $#!T to Good $#!T” recycling campaign. To recap: what is essentially an extremely belabored poop joke has incensed conservatives who are now calling for a boycott of Miller Lite.  If you’re getting a sense of déjà vu from all this, it’s because we have seemingly entered week 934 of rightwing outrage about beer. The Miller Lite debacle follows an extended backlash to Bud Light’s partnership with the trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney last month. When I say “partnership”, I mean that Bud Light sent a personalized beer can to an influencer with 10 million followers who then made a sponsored video and put it on her Instagram page. We’re not talking a giant campaign or a groundbreaking statement about trans rights – we’re talking a tiny nod to inclusivity and an attempt to broaden Bud Light’s reach among a different audience. Which, by the way, is not exactly a huge pivot for Bud Light: the brand has been running ads targeted at the LGBTQ+ community since the late 1990s. And yet there was still a massive backlash and a conservative boycott of Bud Light.  While conservative boycotts generally have very little effect, the backlash from the Mulvaney campaign was intense and reportedly caused a big 21% drop in sales across US retail stores during a week in mid-April, per an analysis of Nielsen figures cited in the Wall Street Journal.  People have every right to express their opinions and to boycott brands. (Unlike many conservatives, I strongly support the right to boycott.) But what happened with Bud Light – and what’s being repeated with Miller Lite – was nothing less than a targeted harassment and intimidation campaign.  Outraged conservatives found the marketing executives responsible for the campaign and hounded them online. Trolls went through social media and found embarrassing photos of Alissa Heinerscheid, who oversaw the partnership between Bud Light and Mulvaney, in college in order to try to paint her as a hypocrite for saying that Bud Light needed to update its “fratty” image. Her face was splashed all over rightwing media sites. She reportedly got death threats.  Both Heinerscheid and Group VP Daniel Blake, who oversaw marketing for Anheuser-Busch’s mainstream brands, were put on leaves of absence. Rather than protecting their employees and sticking by a consistent set of principles, Anheuser-Busch, which owns Bud Light, seemed to throw its executives under the bus and kowtow to the bigoted masses. “We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people,” the company’s CEO, Brendan Whitworth, said in a wishy-washy press release titled Our Responsibility To America. “We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer.” It then released a new patriotic ad pandering to conservatives.  A similar harassment campaign is now being waged against Sofia Colucci, the chief marketing officer for Molson Coors. Rightwing outlets are publishing hit pieces targeting the executive and Colucci has reportedly deleted multiple social media account pages because of the harassment. Thankfully Molson Coors is reacting with a little more courage than Anheuser-Busch and refusing to pander to bigots.  “People can take issue with our ads or our brands, but we won’t stand by as people personally attack our employees – especially given that these are company decisions, and are never made by one single person,” Adam Collins, Molson Coors’ chief communications and corporate affairs officer, told Newsweek on Tuesday. Which is precisely what the people at Bud Light should have said. Indeed, if Anheuser-Busch had reacted with a little more guts, then conservatives might not have felt so emboldened to start attacking executives at Molson Coors.  Conservatives, it should be noted, have been getting outraged at adverts since the advent of television. You don’t have to do much to trigger the right, after all; you just have to remind them that they live in the 21st century. In 2013, for example, a Cheerios ad with an interracial family sparked online outrage from the right (yes, you read that right: 2013). Then in 2016, Old Navy was similarly accused of “anti-white propaganda” because there was an interracial family in its ads.So none of this outrage is new. What does feel new, however, are the targeted attacks on marketing executives and the coordinated attempts to get them fired. The right has a history of using online mobs to get journalists it doesn’t like fired, and now it’s using this playbook to target and censor other industries.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nConservatives are boycotting Miller Lite and Bud Light for their attempts to be more inclusive. \nExecutives at both companies have been targeted with harassment and death threats. \nAnheuser-Busch threw their executives under the bus and pandered to bigots. \nThe right has a history of using online mobs to target and censor industries.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe article discusses the recent outrage from conservatives over Miller Lite and Bud Light's attempts to be more inclusive in their advertising.\nIt highlights the targeted harassment and intimidation campaigns against the marketing executives responsible for the campaigns, and how Anheuser-Busch and Molson Coors have reacted differently.\nThe article also notes that this type of outrage from the right is nothing new, and that they have been using online mobs to target and censor other industries."

        "text": "The \"green energy\" movement claims that it wants cost-effective energy—affordable, reliable, plentiful—just without fossil fuels’ pollution or GHG emissions. But this is contradicted by its hostility toward clean, non-carbon nuclear and hydro—the most proven alternatives to fossil fuels.  You might expect the \"green energy\" movement to be the Number 1 supporter of clean, non-carbon nuclear and hydroelectric energy, but instead, it is the Number 1 opponent. \"Green\" groups have opposed nuclear for decades (leading to crippling costs) and worked to shut down hydroelectric dams.  Why does the \"Green\" movement oppose nuclear and hydro?  It is because \"green\" solar and wind are just so cost-effective and so \"green\"?  BIDEN'S 'CLEAN AND GREEN' PUSH WILL RESULT IN BLACKOUTS AND BANKRUPTCY FOR AMERICA  No. Solar and wind have not proven to be cost-effective at all, and in many ways, they are the least \"green\" form of energy.  READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP  \"Green energy\" isn’t really energy  Calling solar and wind \"green energy\" makes them seem like other forms of energy, just \"green.\" But they’re not. All other forms of energy provide reliable energy—real energy—whereas solar and wind are unreliable parasites of reliable energy.  Despite claims that solar and wind are rapidly replacing fossil fuels, they provide less than 5% of world energy—only electricity, one-fifth of energy—and, crucially, even that small percentage depends on huge subsidies and reliable (mostly fossil-fueled) power plants.  Solar and wind’s basic problem is unreliability, to the point they can go near zero at any time. Thus, they don’t replace reliable power, they parasitize it. This is why they need huge subsidies and why no grid is near 50% solar and wind without huge parasitism on reliable neighbors.  The popular idea that we can use mostly or only solar and wind with sufficient battery backup is not being tried anywhere because it’s economically absurd. Batteries are so expensive that just 3 days of global backup using Elon Musk’s Megapacks would cost $600 trillion, about six times global GDP!  US POWER GRID FACING ELEVATED RISK OF SHORTAGES THIS SUMMER AMID GREEN ENERGY PUSH: WATCHDOG  \"Green\" solar and wind may someday become a part of real energy solutions—if generators using solar and wind are willing to guarantee reliability, instead of generating unreliable power and forcing everyone else to clean up their mess. But today's \"green energy\" is not real energy. If solar and wind ever become truly cost-effective, you can be certain of one thing: the \"green energy\" movement will oppose them as insufficiently \"green\" given their huge \"environmental impacts.\"  \"Green energy\" isn’t really green  If solar and wind became cost-effective and deployed on a large scale, they would have a level of \"environmental impact\" from mining and land use that would make the \"green movement\" oppose them. In fact, this is already happening. \"Green\" means minimal or nonexistent \"environmental impact.\"  Because sunlight and wind are dilute sources of energy—they take up more space and use more of many materials than fossil fuels or nuclear. This massive \"environmental impact\" is not at all \"green.\"  Consider the land use requirements of solar. The world uses over 165,000 TWh of energy per year, which requires ~19 billion kW of power on average. An optimistic, real-world power density for solar projects is 10 Watts per square meter. To power the world, you’d need ~1.8 million square kilometers of solar PV projects.  If 1.8 million square kilometers of solar panels doesn’t seem like much, note that it is more than all cities, towns, villages, and human infrastructure combined (~1.5 million square kilometers).  And this excludes the huge footprints of solar and battery mining, manufacturing, and transmission. Consider the mining requirements of solar, wind, and batteries. An International Energy Agency projection for a \"net zero\" scenario shows an increase in mining and processing of minerals such as lithium, graphite, nickel, and rare earths by 4,200%, 2,500%, 1,900%, and 700% by 2040.  Because \"green energy\" has so much environmental impact, even on today’s small scale it faces huge \"green\" opposition to its land use, mining, and transmission-line-building requirements. For example, the Biden administration recently shut down a prime \"green energy\" mining site in Minnesota.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  If \"green\" solar and wind aren’t really energy, and if they have so much environmental impact that the \"green\" movement opposes them in practice, then why does the green movement so enthusiastically support them rhetorically? To hide its real goal: radically reducing energy use.  \"Green\"—\"minimal human impact\"—is a fundamentally anti-energy idea. Energy is \"the capacity to do work,\" which means transforming—impacting—our environment. The more energy we use, the more we transform Earth, the more impact we have. If you don’t want us to impact Earth you ultimately must oppose every form of energy.  The fundamental hostility of the \"green\" movement to energy explains why throughout its history it has never supported current, cost-effective sources of energy and only \"supported\" imaginary sources of energy that might exist in the future.  \"Green\" leaders supported nuclear—until it became cost-effective, at which point they demonized and criminalized it. \"Green\" leaders supported natural gas—until it became cost-effective on a global scale thanks to shale energy tech, at which point they demonized it as \"fracking.\"  Because the \"green\" movement is anti-energy, any enthusiasm its leaders express for fusion is phony; while they may claim to want clean, cheap, abundant energy before it exists, they will not like the impact it has once it exists. And in the past, green leaders admitted this.  Amory Lovins, the leader of the modern \"green energy\" movement, said in the 1970s: \"If you ask me, it'd be little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap, abundant energy, because of what we would do with it.\"  The world needs to reject the \"green\" movement and instead embrace a \"human flourishing\" movement that embraces intelligent human impact on Earth as a good thing. It's one that both embraces today’s most cost-effective energy sources—including fossil fuels—and is eager to improve on them.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe article argues that the \"green energy\" movement is not actually interested in cost-effective energy, but instead is opposed to clean, non-carbon nuclear and hydroelectric energy.\nIt claims that solar and wind are unreliable and expensive, and that they have a huge environmental impact from mining and land use.\nThe article suggests that the \"green\" movement is actually anti-energy, and that it is only interested in reducing energy use.\nIt calls for a \"human flourishing\" movement that embraces intelligent human impact on Earth as a good thing.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe \"green energy\" movement is actually the biggest opponent of clean, non-carbon nuclear and hydroelectric energy. \nSolar and wind are unreliable and require huge subsidies and parasitism on reliable energy sources. \nThe \"green energy\" movement is actually anti-energy and seeks to reduce energy use. \nThe world needs to embrace a \"human flourishing\" movement that embraces intelligent human impact on Earth as a good thing."

It appears that they are re-inviting a group that is involved with anti-Christian activities. This, of course, is angering most of the conservative fans that follow the Dodgers regardless of them hosting their own gay pride.  According to Breitbart, CatholicVote is pledging to resume its campaign urging the Dodgers to sever ties with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. This is following the Dodger’s decision to extend an invitation for the hate group to be on honor at the June 16 LGBTQ+ Pride Night event.  In a press release on Monday, CatholicVote President Brian Burch expressed his determination to launch an intense advertising onslaught targeting the team throughout Los Angeles and during game broadcasts. Burch describes the team’s action as a direct insult to the Catholic community. He also vows to raise $1 million swiftly to deliver a relentless advertising campaign that the Dodgers cannot disregard.  Drag nun queens for Dodgers pride event?  The baseball team is receiving backlash after backlash. Staunch Christian supporters state that they are ignoring the majority of their fan base. Furthermore, conservatives are stating that the Dodgers are going to face a backlash as intense as the Bud Light debacle. For this, we will simply have to wait and see what’s next.  Following that, there are questions regarding the mocking of other religions. A conservative user states that it is unfair to invite a hate group targeting specifically Catholics. Furthermore, the same would definitely not be tolerated if it involved other religions. There are some users that state these are drag performers, and they do not mean harm towards any religion.  Users are talking about how the Dodgers will definitely suffer from economic backlash from the conservatives. Furthermore, others state that Target was close to receiving the same treatment, but they got scared and are backing out from the woke ideology.

        "text": "© Gene J. Puskar/AP Photo An independent fire investigation commissioned by the New Jersey DOT found that design flaws from John Deere led to exhaust leaks that were an “underlying” cause of the fires that forced the state to sideline over 140 tractors. The New Jersey Department of Transportation spent an extra $4 million in 2022 to hire contractors to cut grass along highways and state roads after the state sidelined over 140 tractors because three of them caught fire, according to records obtained by POLITICO and a DOT spokesperson. Nearly half the fleet of tractors remains out of service as they undergo fire-preventative renovations, according to DOT spokesperson Jim Barry, costing the state resources in addition to the millions it paid to hire interim contractors. The scenario was the subject of an internal state complaint dated June 2022 filed to a division within the Treasury tasked with overseeing disputes with state vendors. The state filed the complaint against the company from which it purchased 147 John Deere tractors and mowing attachments in 2018 and 2019, at a price of approximately $11.4 million, according to the complaint. An independent fire investigation commissioned by the DOT — attached to the complaint and obtained by POLITICO through a records request — found that design flaws from John Deere led to exhaust leaks that were an “underlying” cause of the fires. It also found that the company that manufactured mowing attachments, Diamond Mowers, had a design flaw that trapped combustible debris. The report concluded that both companies as well as Power Place, the middleman the state purchased the tractors from, “failed to provide warnings about the fire hazard.” A spokesperson for John Deere declined to answer a detailed list of questions. Diamond Mowers did not respond to a request for comment. In an interview, Power Place president Gus Ottoson said that while his company was served the complaint, they did not have a role in modifying, altering or manufacturing the tractors or their attachments. Ottoson also said that while his company, John Deere and Diamond Mowers conducted maintenance training for their products, he could not comment on whether those trainings were being followed or on the specifics of the fire investigation. “We just sell a widget,” he said in an interview. “Home Depot sells a lawn mower out of a box — it's essentially the same thing, although a lot more complex.” Talks are ongoing between the DOT, John Deere, Diamond Mowers and Power Place to add fire-preventative fixes to the rest of the fleet, according to Barry. Currently, 53 percent of the tractor fleet is operational after fire-preventative fixes while the remainder of the tractor fleet undergoes safety renovations, according to Barry. Costs for the renovations will not be paid for by the state, according to Barry. According to Treasury spokesperson Darryl Isherwood, the DOT can take steps to sue the vendor or “seek monetary damages” if it chooses, although it is unclear if it will take those steps. “We’ll reserve our decision on how to approach that $4 million with John Deere until we get all our mowers fixed,” DOT Commissioner Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti said Tuesday afternoon when lawmakers asked during a budget hearing about POLITICO’s reporting. “Then we’ll have the opportunity to make the decision on how to pursue the $4 million.” A design flaw that risked every tractor in the fleet, documents say The complaint, filed with the Contract Compliance Audit Unit, initially said $6.4 million would be spent on interim grass cutters. But according to Barry, the final costs came in lower than what was initially estimated and totaled around $4 million for 2022. The DOT does \"not plan to use contractors to cut grass this year\" Barry said in a statement. According to the complaint and fire investigation, three tractors caught fire between October 2020 and August 2021. In one instance, according to the fire investigation, the tractor fire grew so intense that “a fire extinguisher would have been useless.” According to the fire investigation done by Atlantic Professional Services Inc., all three fires had exhaust gas leaks, which was attributed to “defectively installed” parts from the John Deere factory. “John Deere is clearly responsible for the for the exhaust leaks that provided the heat to ignite the fires,” according to the investigation Diamond Mowers, which creates mowing attachments for the tractors, had a design flaw that let debris accumulate in equipment parts that was difficult to see and access, which “create[d] a risk of fire in every tractor of the NJDOT fleet” according to the investigation. According to Ottoson, Power Place is in the process of refurbishing the tractors and John Deere and Diamond Mowers will reimburse his company for the price of the renovations. Ottoson said he anticipated the entire fleet to be refurbished by summer. Ottoson said he was not aware whether John Deere or Diamond Mowers would reimburse the state for the millions spent on interim contractors. Ottoson said the responsibility did not fall on his company. “If you went to Home Depot and bought a lawn tractor and for whatever reason it failed and you had to hire interim people to cut your grass, Home Depot isn’t going to reimburse you for that,” he said. “It's kind of apples and oranges, but it's comparable in a way. It's unfortunate but it was the state’s decision.” Power Place’s contract with the state that procured the tractors that caught fire is on “pay only” status, meaning that the state cannot buy new materials under that specific contract — in this case the John Deere 5100E tractors — but can continue paying for what was already purchased. The state still has active contracts directly with John Deere to purchase tractors, although spokespeople for the DOT and the Treasury emphasized that the John Deere contracts are for a different tractor model — not the one that was catching fire.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe New Jersey Department of Transportation spent an extra $4 million in 2022 to hire contractors to cut grass after 140 tractors caught fire. \nAn independent fire investigation found that design flaws from John Deere and Diamond Mowers were an “underlying” cause of the fires. \nThe state has filed a complaint against the companies from which it purchased the tractors and mowing attachments. \nTalks are ongoing between the DOT, John Deere, Diamond Mowers and Power Place to add fire-preventative fixes to the rest of the fleet.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe New Jersey Department of Transportation (DOT) spent an extra $4 million in 2022 to hire contractors to cut grass along highways and state roads after the state sidelined over 140 tractors due to three of them catching fire.\nAn independent fire investigation commissioned by the DOT found that design flaws from John Deere and Diamond Mowers led to exhaust leaks that were an “underlying” cause of the fires.\nTalks are ongoing between the DOT, John Deere, Diamond Mowers and Power Place to add fire-preventative fixes to the rest of the fleet.\nThe state can take steps to sue the vendor or “seek monetary damages” if it chooses."

She was sentenced Tuesday to 27 months in prison for her role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. ( Pauline Bauer at Bob's Trading Post, her restaurant in Hamilton, Pa. She was sentenced Tuesday to 27 months in prison for her role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. ( (Michael Kunzelman / Associated Press) A Pennsylvania restaurant owner who screamed death threats at then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while storming the U.S. Capitol was sentenced Tuesday to more than two years in prison. Pauline Bauer was near Pelosi's office suite on Jan. 6, 2021, when she yelled at police officers to bring out the California Democrat so the mob of supporters of President Trump could hang her. In January, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden convicted Bauer of riot-related charges after hearing trial testimony without a jury. The judge sentenced her to two years and three months of imprisonment, giving her credit for the several months she has already served in jail, court records show. Prosecutors had recommended a prison term of six years and six months. Bauer, 55, of Kane, Pa., was part of the mob that forced police officers on the East Plaza to retreat. After forcing her way into the Capitol, she accosted officers who were trying to secure the Rotunda, shoving one, and yelled at them to “bring them out or we’re coming in,” according to federal prosecutors. “They’re criminals. They need to hang,” she screamed. “Bring Nancy Pelosi out here now. We want to hang [her]. Bring her out.\" Other rioters shouted threats against Pelosi as they roamed through the Capitol. “Bauer’s threat to hang Speaker Pelosi was real, imminent, and placed the Speaker of the House in danger,” prosecutor James Peterson wrote in a court filing. Bauer traveled from her north Pennsylvania home to attend Trump's “Stop the Steal” rally Jan. 6 in Washington. She had attended a similar rally the day before in Harrisburg, Pa. She came to Washington with at least five other people who have been charged in the Capitol riot, including co-defendant William Blauser, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge. Last year, McFadden ordered Blauser to pay a $500 fine but didn’t sentence him to incarceration or probation. McFadden convicted Bauer of all five counts in her indictment, including a felony charge that she obstructed the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress that certified Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory. Defense attorney Komron Jon Maknoon said Bauer never intended to interfere with the process of certifying the electoral college vote. She “genuinely regrets her past actions” and doesn't pose a threat to the public, he wrote. \"The international spotlight showcasing her at her worst has deeply affected her,\" Maknoon wrote. Prosecutors said Bauer lied during her trial testimony, giving a bogus explanation for her confrontation with police and claiming she didn't remember threatening Pelosi. Bauer has used “sovereign citizen” extremist rhetoric and filed “nonsense\" court documents while defending herself, prosecutors said. More than a year before the trial, McFadden ordered Bauer to be jailed for several months for violating conditions of her release. She had claimed that the court has no authority over her and told the judge she doesn’t want “any lawyering from the bench.” During a 2021 interview, Bauer said her arrest on Capitol riot charges led to a mixed reaction from neighbors in Kane, a town on the edge of the Allegheny National Forest. “A lot of people say that they’re proud of me for standing up for my rights,” she told the Associated Press. Bauer said her restaurant, Bob’s Trading Post, was thriving before the COVID-19 pandemic. She became known in her hometown as an outspoken critic of lockdown measures that cost her business. More than 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes for their conduct on Jan. 6. More than 500 of them have been sentenced, with more than half receiving prison terms ranging from one week to 18 years.

        "text": "Â© TNS A U.S. flag and Pride flag are flown in Chelsea on June 20, 2020, in New York City.  The old cultural imperialism was supposedly greedy corporatism like Disneyland, McDonaldâs, and Starbucks sprouting up worldwide to supplant local competitors.  But these businesses spread because they appealed to free-will consumer demand abroad. They were not imposed top down.  The U.S. presence in Afghanistan collapsed in August 2021 amid the greatest American military humiliation in modern history. A billion-dollar new embassy was abandoned. Hundreds of millions of dollarsâ worth of new infrastructure at the huge Bagram Airbase was dumped.  Â© Provided by Tribune Content Agency Victor Davis Hanson  We still do not know how many billions of dollars of sophisticated new weapons were left to the Taliban and now are making their way through global terroristsâ marts.  Yet, in our skedaddle, the LGBTQ flag still flew high from our new Kabul embassy. A George Floyd mural was prominent on city streets.  And gender studies programs â to the tune of $787 million in American subsidies â were showcased at Kabul University, in one of the most conservative Islamic countries in the world.  Rainbow flags and Black Lives Matter banners have hung from our embassy in South Korea.  Such partisan cultural activism is a diplomatic first.  The woke Left has now weaponized the countryâs diplomatic missions abroad to advance highly partisan and controversial agendas that can offend their hosts, and do not represent the majority of American voters at home.  American foreign policy toward other nations seems now to hinge on their positions on transgender people, LGBTQ promotion, abortion, climate change, and an array of woke issues from using multiple pronouns on passports to showcasing transgender ambassadors.  The Biden Administration in January 2022 stopped the EastMed pipeline. That joint effort of our allies Cyprus, Greece, and Israel sought to bring much needed clean-burning Mediterranean natural gas to southern Europe.  Apparently, our diplomats felt it violated our own New Green Deal orthodoxies. So we imperialists interfered to destroy a vital project of our closest allies.  The White House manifesto called the âNational Strategy on Gender Equity and Equalityâ offers a blueprint for how to massage nations abroad to accept our values that are increasingly at odds with much of the worldâs.  Do Americans really believe that embracing drag-queen shows at military bases, abortion to the moment of birth, transgender men competing in womenâs sports, and the promised effort to ban the internal combustion engine are effective ways to ensure good relations with the United States?  No wonder the Biden Administrationâs new cultural imperialism is proving disastrous for a variety of reasons.  One, these imperialistic and chauvinistic agendas are pushed abroad at the very time the respect for the U.S. military is at an all-time low. It was humiliated in Afghanistan. It is now unable to recruit sufficient qualified soldiers. Its stocks of critical weapons are depleted.  The Pentagon leadership of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, along with Joe Biden, do not radiate competence.  But they do exude woke pieties.  While we offend Middle East oil exporters and Central Europeans, China allies with Russia and Iran. India and Turkey triangulate away from the United States. Sanctimonious hectoring while appearing weak is a bad combination.  Two, these warped standards are incoherent. Is an abortion-on-demand, totalitarian China therefore an ally? How could we damn supposedly non-woke Saudi Arabia as we begged it to pump more of its non-green oil before the 2022 midterms?  Some of our most loyal allies are in Eastern Europe â Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Romania. These countries have experienced traumatic histories on the front lines against Islamic Ottoman expansionism, czarist and Soviet aggression, and German Nazi bullying and invasion.  They are democratic and pro-American. Yet they are now targeted by our woke imperialists because they remain steadfast as the most religious and traditional of our European allies.  Yet these nations would be more likely to dispatch credible forces for NATOâs defense than many of our left-wing, woke, and militarily less capable Western European nations.  Three, most of the 7.9 billion people in the world are not woke. They are aspiring to obtain a modicum of the luxury and affluence taken for granted in America.  The rest of the planet worries whether it will have enough food, energy, security, and shelter to live one more day. For most, the incessant, woke virtue-signaling from affluent Americans comes across as the whiny bullying of pampered, self-righteous â and increasingly neurotic â imperialists.  Four, traditionally the party that controls the State Department does not politically weaponize its embassies with wedge issues that have not won majority support among Americans.  Such abject politicalization rattles and alienates foreign nations. They do not want to be drawn into the American Leftâs internal propaganda efforts that they know are bitterly controversial inside the United States.  How odd that those on the Left who in the past decried âAmerican imperialismâ are now proving the greatest imperialists of all.

        "text": "Â© Provided by Washington Examiner President Joe Biden speaks at a ceremony honoring the Council of Chief State School Officers' 2023 National and State Teachers of the Year at the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 24, 2023.  It doesnât take long for reality to catch up with people who spend their money recklessly.  If the situation is not too far gone, it may be simply a question of cutting back temporarily on unnecessary purchases. However, if the overspending has persisted for a long period of time, an individual may be forced by outsiders, such as credit card companies or banks, into concessions with which they disagree.  REJECT BIDEN'S ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH AND EMBRACE A TRUE PRO-FAMILY VISION  Such is the predicament the White House finds itself in at the moment. The Biden administrationâs two-and-a-half-year spending spree has driven up the United States national debt to a whopping $31.4 trillion dollars, and the government is rapidly approaching the day when it can no longer pay its bills.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen notified Congress on Monday that if the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended soon, the government could default on its debt as early as June 1. Needless to say, a default by the U.S. government would be a shock to the world economy and must be avoided.  Last week, House Republicans narrowly passed the \"Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023\" bill. This legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion (or until the end of March 2024), in return for $4.8 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years. Far from being as unreasonable as the White House is making it out to be, this GOP package would merely return federal spending to 2022 levels.  Ahead of the billâs passage, White House spokeswoman Robyn Patterson told Fox News: \"The Speakerâs Limit Growth Act is an attack on American manufacturing, American law enforcement, and American families, all in the name of making it easier for the richest Americans to cheat on their taxes, and paying for even more tax giveaways that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.â  The White House accused House Republicans of breaking their \"Commitment to America\" and claimed that Biden was the only one who was âdemonstrating an actual commitment\" to the American people.  Biden insists on a âcleanâ increase in the debt ceiling, meaning he wants âno strings attached.â  In a recent interview with NPR, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients said the president would like to keep the debt ceiling increase separate from discussions about spending cuts. In other words, just give us the increase, and weâll address spending issues at a later time. Does anyone recall how a similar promise made to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) went down last summer?  Two things are true: The White House canât be trusted, and thatâs not the way it works in a divided government. According to Reuters, âCongress has often paired debt-ceiling increases with other budget and spending measures.â Like it or not, with only a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate and Republican control of the House, Biden is not in a position to call all the shots. He must make concessions. While he doesnât have to give House Speaker Kevin McCarthy everything Republicans are asking for, he must make a meaningful counteroffer.  The Biden administration has been aware of this looming showdown for months. The government hit the $31.4 trillion dollar debt limit on Jan. 19.  McCarthy last met with Biden on Feb. 1. Following their meeting, the White House issued a statement that said their demand for a âcleanâ bill was \"not negotiable or conditional.\" McCarthy told reporters he had rejected Bidenâs demand. He said, \"That's not gonna happen. We're not just gonna keep spending and just raise the limit on our credit card.â  There have been no further discussions between the two in the past three months. Yellenâs warning to Congress, however, prompted Biden to arrange a meeting with congressional leaders, which is set for next Tuesday.  But the White Houseâs tone is still one of defiance. At Tuesdayâs White House briefing, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stridently told reporters that Yellenâs âupdated projection should be a wake-up call to Congress. It is time for the speaker and the MAGA Republicans to stop the brinkmanship and act to prevent default.â  âIt is Congressâs constitutional obligation to act, not hold the full faith and credit of the United States hostage unless we allow them to make cuts to programs hardworking Americans rely upon.â  She said the president has been very clear: âThis is not an issue that we will negotiate on. The debt limit was increased three times under President Trump. â¦ [T]he only practical path to avoid default is for Congress to suspend the debt limit without conditions.â  The debt ceiling was indeed lifted three times during the Trump administration. But the claim that the Democrats âsupplied their votes â¦ without issuing demandsâ is not true.  The Washington Examinerâs Conn Carroll details the very significant concessions the Democrats extracted during debt limit negotiations. For example, in July 2019, Carroll notes that Democrats âwon $324 billion in new spending and the end of the spending caps in the Budget Control Act. It was a huge victory for Democrats.â  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  In a divided government, everything is negotiable. And Democrats are well aware of that.

        "text": "Thursday’s conviction of four Proud Boys leaders for their seditious conspiracy to overthrow the United States government on January 6, 2021 is a landmark victory for democracy and the rule of law.  Throughout the four-month federal trial in the District of Columbia, defendants repeatedly tried to cast doubt on the seriousness of the Proud Boys as an organization, encouraging the jurors to question whether it was capable of plotting an assault on the Capitol.  With this conviction, those doubts should be put to rest. As evidence from both the Department of Justice and the House Select Committee showed, the Proud Boys mobilized with military-style discipline and tactics in advance of their attack on the Capitol. Their leaders used encrypted chats to plot out their strategy, as well as to communicate with prominent allies of then-President Donald Trump, like Roger Stone.  Despite attempts by the Proud Boys to dismiss themselves as a “fraternity” or a “drinking club,” this verdict should expose all Americans to the truth: that the Proud Boys are an extremist, neo-fascist paramilitary group that seeks to use vigilante violence against their enemies.  But most importantly, Americans must understand that the threat posed by the Proud Boys is far from over. While these convictions are a crucial first step in holding the Proud Boys accountable for their actions on January 6 and diminishing their ability to attract a widespread following, the anti-democratic violence that they unleashed at the Capitol is still a potent threat.  On January 6, 2021, a broad coalition of extremists came together to violently oppose the peaceful transfer of power. Now, the Proud Boys and other remnants of the January 6 coalition are geographically dispersed but ideologically united as they seek to inject violence and fear into the culture wars now being fought in towns and cities across the United States.  Since serving as the tip of the spear on January 6, the Proud Boys have largely retreated from the limelight they enjoyed in the lead-up to the attack. As federal pressure forced the group to eschew national-level organizing, individual chapters have adjusted their strategy to pursue a more localized campaign of violence and intimidation against new targets, including the LGBTQ+ community.  This reinvigorated offensive has largely been focused on drag performances, as Proud Boys spread dangerous conspiracies about LGBTQ+ individuals sexually “grooming” minors and use those conspiracies as an excuse to self-deploy to drag shows, often heavily armed.  The tactical evolution of the Proud Boys since January 6 largely mirrors a broader shift in the domestic violent extremist landscape in this period. Just as a coalition of far-right extremists weaponized President Trump’s stolen election narrative as they mobilized ahead of the Capitol attack, these same groups and movements continue to exploit popular narratives that help to radicalize an increasingly broad group of Americans.  These narratives have focused on supposed threats to American families and culture, with the Proud Boys and others warning that their political opponents are seeking to destroy the country as we know it. In this apocalyptic view, anyone standing in opposition to the Proud Boys are legitimate targets for hateful rhetoric, harassment, dehumanization and violence – like the Capitol Police who stood in their way on January 6.  After a few months spent disrupting school board meetings that were trying to implement Covid-19 vaccine guidelines or racially inclusive curricula, the Proud Boys seized on rising currents of homophobia and transphobia to remake their agenda and electrify their supporters.  Since 2022, the Proud Boys have organized over 150 armed demonstrations at drag events, according to a report by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. Some events have been canceled because of a fear of violence, while others have devolved into violent clashes between Proud Boys and supporters of the LGBTQ+ community. As attacks on the LGBTQ+ community continue to dominate American politics, the Proud Boys have once more positioned themselves as leading a crusade against evil. We know where that leads.  Make no mistake: these seditious conspiracy convictions are a body blow to the Proud Boys’ embattled national organization. But the mobilization of local Proud Boys chapters against the LGBTQ+ community shows that their threat remains, whatever the future holds for the Proud Boys as a nationwide entity.  Therefore, the guilty verdicts should be an opportunity for our country to remind itself of the threat that is posed by anti-democratic extremists who are still menacing our families and communities.  We must educate ourselves about laws in all 50 states that prohibit activities by private paramilitary groups like the Proud Boys. We must reject the persistent attempts to whitewash the Proud Boys and their allies as they try to force themselves back into the mainstream. Finally, we must stand up to political violence by remaining engaged in civic life and redoubling our commitment to democracy.  In the end, that’s the verdict that the Proud Boys fear most.

While 25 is great, it’s not 34. She knew the number was corrected upwards by the group that did the poll. The RINOS & Globalists can have her. Fox News should only use REAL Stars!!!”  A DEBT LIMIT WIN FOR THE GOP  McEnany, who was arguably Trump’s most effective press secretary during his time in the White House, is now an analyst for Fox News and, after committing the apparent crime of poll inaccuracy, has been rejected with the worst insult imaginable — she’s not a “REAL” star!  But this is far from isolated. In reality, Trump’s decision to declare social media war on McEnany is the latest in a string of increasingly bizarre outbursts targeting those who were once key members of his own campaign and administration.  Setting aside the problem with Trump’s rampant declaration of former employees as incompetent — which poses the obvious follow-up question: Why did he hire them? — we must recognize that with every passing day, Trump is alienating everyone and anyone of any value who could help him win the 2024 presidential election if he does become the Republican nominee.  Not only that, but what’s next if he does win?  The early days of Trump’s administration were the most impressive, and much of this is due to the quality of those within Trump’s administration. As time goes on, though, it is natural for the roster to change. And unfortunately, these changes are usually not for the better.  So if Trump continues to demand cultlike loyalty from everyone around him, including the public, without showing any loyalty for those same people, and especially to those who helped him achieve political success in the first place, who will be left?  At this rate, the only people left in the room will be Laura Loomer and Alex Bruesewitz, hardly a dream team if your objective goes beyond social media clicks.  It’s undeniable that political primaries are breeding grounds for division and infighting, but part of the political art of such races involves the simultaneous ability to choose which fights are worth having and which relationships are worth protecting.

        "text": "Â© Provided by The Mary Sue  Why didnât she scream? Why didnât she call 911 instead of her friend? What about those four-inch heels she was wearing? The questions former President Donald J. Trumpâs Lawyer hurled at E. Jean Carroll in the first few days of her civil rape lawsuit against him were as offensive as they were familiar.  Carroll, a writer and former advice columnist for Elle who first came forward with her story in 2019, has accused Trump of raping her in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman in the mid-1990s. She is now suing him for battery and defamation under a New York law that temporarily removes the statute of limitations for adult victims.  Taking the stand during the first several days of the trial, which began on April 25, Carroll testified about the details of how the alleged encounter escalated from flirtatious banter to violent assault, as well as decades of trauma that followed. She explained her reluctance at the time to accuse a powerful man who could likely destroy her and the reasons she changed her mindâinspired by a cultural movement of women who were coming forward to challenge their attackers.  âWhen that happened, across the country women began telling their stories, and I was flummoxed â¦ wait a minute, can we actually speak up and not be pummeled?â Carroll testified. âI thought, well this may be a way to change the culture of sexual violence. The light dawned. I thought, we can actually change things if we all tell our stories. And I thought by god, this may be the time.â  Unfortunately, victims of sexual violence have not yet reached a point where they can speak up without fear of consequences, as Carroll has experienced ever since she added her story to the dozens of similar accusations made by other women against Trump.  While cross-examining Carroll, Trump attorney Joe Tacopina went after her credibility and motives, throwing every seedy rape defense strategy in the book at her. He accused her of making up a story for attention and money, even though Carroll lost her job as an advice columnist at Elle and much of the attention she has received has been in the form of insults from internet trolls, including the former president, and threats to her safety.  Although Carrollâs account was detailed and consistent, Tacopina zeroed in on what she didnât recall, including the precise date the alleged assault happened decades ago and the fact that she didnât remember seeing or interacting with anyone else in the store that day.  And while she says she fought back and freed herself, he wanted to know why she didnât scream.  A scream would have been an understandable response to this line of questioning, but as Carroll explained, she is simply not a screamer. Instead, she responded with poise and clarity, standing up for not just herself but for all victims who have been attacked for not reacting to their own rapes in the ârightâ way. Her testimony led twitter users to post about their own experiences with the hashtag #IDidntScream.  âOne of the reasons women donât come forward is because theyâre always asked, âWhy didnât you scream?ââ Carroll testified, as reported by Washington Post reporters inside the courtroom. âSome women scream; some women donât. It keeps women silent.â She then raised her voice to add, âHe raped me whether I screamed or not.â  Â© Provided by The Mary Sue (screengrab, CBS News)  In her column âWhy Didnât She Scream? And Other Questions Not to Ask a Rape Accuser,â New York Times editor Jessica Bennett described the disturbingly long history of re-victimizing victims with such lines of questioningâdating back to the case of a 17-year-old seamstress who was raped in 1793. The defense in that case relied on a series of tests that were meant to decide whether the accuser was credible: Did she have a good reputation? Did she call out for help? Did she have injuries from the attack? Did she report the crime right away?  The way victims of sexual assault are questioned has apparently not changed much in more than two centuries. Does anyone truly wonder why Carroll or anyone else hesitates to report?  âWe donât ask victims of other violent crimes if they screamed outâto the contrary, not screaming is considered a way to not further provoke,â Bennett asked. âWhy then, when it comes to victims of sexual violence, are those tropes so baked in?  U.S. Judge Lewis Kaplan seemed as annoyed with Tacopinaâs hackneyed antics as anyone, repeatedly scolding him for being argumentative and repetitive. The judgeâs rebukes were so harsh that Trumpâs lawyer filed a Hail Mary mistrial motion first thing Monday morning, complaining that the judge had made âpervasive unfair and prejudicial rulingsâ and asking for more leeway in his cross-examination of Carroll. Kaplan wasted no time denying the ridiculous request that he overrule himself.  Tacopina continued to cross-examine Carroll on Monday, wearing on all of our patience. Still to come, the jury will also hear from two more women who have made similar accusations against Trump. If these past few days/centuries have been any indication, the defense will try to paint them as attention-seeking liars whose skirts were probably too short, as well.

        "text": "© Provided by The Hill  Last week, after deliberating for seven days, a jury convicted four members of the Proud Boys, including leader Enrique Tarrio, of seditious conspiracy for their role in the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. In two trials, ending in November 2022 and January 2023, seven members of the Oath Keepers, including founder Stewart Rhodes, were found guilty of the same crime.  Unfortunately, our 24/7 news cycle, which places a premium on “breaking news” and is often presented within highly partisan media silos, left out detailed documentation of the danger to American democracy posed by rightwing paramilitary groups — and the support these groups’ enjoy among Republican politicians and voters.  As defined in a statute enacted during the Civil War, seditious conspiracy is an attempt by two or more persons to “conspire to overthrow, put down, or destroy by force the government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States.”  Seditious conspiracy can be difficult to prove. Prior to the Jan. 6 trials, the last conviction occurred in 1995, when Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman was found guilty of seditious conspiracy in a plot to bomb New York City landmarks.  The voluminous evidence in the Proud Boys case included Tarrio’s post-Jan. 6 claim, “Make no mistake. We did this.” Before Jan. 6, prosecutors demonstrated, Oath Keepers stashed a large stockpile of firearms and other weapons in a hotel in Arlington, Va., to be used as needed.  “We should have brought rifles,” Rhodes declared after Jan. 6. “We should have fixed it right then and there… I’d hang [expletive] Pelosi from the lamppost.”  Most important, as Jill Huntley Taylor, CEO of a trial consulting firm, has written, Donald Trump occupied “the empty chair” at the defense table. Lawyers for the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers often rhetorically pointed to Trump, in effect acknowledging prosecutors’ claims that their clients were “thirsting for violence and organizing for action” as “Donald Trump’s army.”  Nayib Hassan, an attorney representing Tarrio, maintained that prosecutors were trying to make his client “a scapegoat for Donald Trump and those in power.” The former president’s words, motivation and anger, Hassan added, “caused what occurred on Jan. 6.”  Norm Pattis, a lawyer representing Joe Biggs, another Proud Boys defendant, claimed that he, too, had come to Washington D.C., because his “commander-in-chief told them a lie.”  The former president has continued to heap praise on the insurrectionists. “These were peaceful people,” he insists. Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by a policeman as she attempted to break into the Capitol, was “an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman.” Because the Department of Justice and the FBI “are destroying the lives of so many Great American Patriots, before our very eyes.”  Trump has indicated that he would pardon individuals convicted of attempting to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden election victory and assaulting law enforcement officers: “I mean full pardons with apologies to many.” The crowd at one of Trump’s rallies this spring heard “Justice for All,” a song recorded by Jan. 6 inmates, along with the former president’s recital of the “Pledge of Allegiance.”  Last month, at a campaign reception in the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, N.H.,  aides told Trump that Micki Larson-Olson, “a Jan. 6er,” had traveled hundreds of miles to meet him. A QAnon supporter, Larson-Olson climbed the scaffolding set up for Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 6, bragged that six officers struggled to remove her, was convicted of unlawful entry to the Capitol grounds and spent 160 days in prison.  She told reporters she “would like a front seat” for the execution of Mike Pence. Trump signed the backpack Larson-Olson said she was carrying on Jan. 6, embraced her, kissed her on the cheek, called her a “terrific woman” and urged her to “hang in there.”  “What had been done to Jan. 6 patriots,” Trump added, “was so bad.”  The Jan. 6 commission’s public hearings, the seditious conspiracy trials and convictions and Trump’s over-the-top comments may be having an impact on GOP voters. In a March poll, only 27 percent of them approved or somewhat approved of the Jan. 6 insurrection; increasingly, Republicans acknowledge that Trump and his allies have not presented credible evidence of fraud in the 2020 election.  That said, Trump remains the front-runner for the GOP 2024 presidential nomination. This even though Trump continues to lie about 2020 presidential election; provided the words, motivation and anger that convinced supporters to launch an assault on the U.S. Capitol; retained classified documents at Mar-a-Lago instead of complying with a subpoena to return them; pressured officials to “find” votes to change the outcome of the 2020 election in Georgia after a hand-count audit had been completed and the results certified by the state’s Republican governor and secretary of state; and was convicted of sexual battery and defamation.

        "text": "© Stocktrek Images - Getty Images The U.S. Navy is decommissioning two nuclear aircraft carriers in a row: The USS Nimitz and USS Eisenhower will soon be history.  It’s time to wish fair winds and following seas to some of the U.S. Navy’s shrinking fleet.  The service will decommission two nuclear aircraft carriers, and two Independence-class Littoral Combat Ships will go up for sale to foreign militaries. The USS Nimitz will leave the service in 2026, while the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower will retire a year later. It’s part of a long-term effort to modernize the current fleet of 297 ships.  Decommissioning History  Over the decades, the two aircraft carriers heading to the chopping block have played significant roles in military conflicts. The 48-year-old USS Nimitz (CVN-68) was commissioned in 1975 and built for a 50-year service life.  The Nimitz is one of the largest warships in the world, with a length of 1,092 feet, a beam of 252 feet, and a displacement of 100,020 tons. It can carry up to 90 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and has a crew of about 6,000 personnel. The ship is powered by two Westinghouse A4W nuclear reactors that provide a speed of over 30 knots and an unlimited range. It has sensors and weapons systems including radars, electronic warfare systems, Sea Sparrow and Rolling Airframe missiles, Phalanx close-in weapons systems, and.50-caliber machine guns.  The Nimitz will sail to a Virginia shipyard after its last deployment to begin the complex deactivation process which involves removing nuclear fuel. Another former nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise, has been engaged in a long-term deactivation process.  “Enterprise and Nimitz are similar in that they are large, rugged ships containing low levels of various hazardous materials. However, they are of considerably different design, so the approach to inactivation will reflect those differences,” Jamie Koehler, a Naval Sea Systems Command spokeswoman, told Breaking Defense.  The USS Eisenhower, commissioned in 1977, can carry up to 90 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and has a crew of about 6,000 personnel.  LCS, We Hardly Knew You  The beleaguered class of Littoral Combat Ships will also see its numbers trimmed. USS Jackson (LCS-6) and USS Montgomery (LCS-8), commissioned in 2015 and 2016, will be sold to foreign navies. A total of 23 LCS vessels were commissioned over time, but Navy officials said that refocusing the class on mine countermeasure missions means fewer ships are needed.  The LCSs have been criticized for lacking armor, firepower, and redundancy, making them vulnerable to enemy attacks and accidents. The ships have also suffered from cost overruns and reliability issues.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe US Navy is decommissioning two nuclear aircraft carriers, the USS Nimitz and USS Eisenhower, as part of a long-term effort to modernize the fleet. \nThe USS Nimitz and USS Eisenhower have played significant roles in military conflicts and have a crew of about 6,000 personnel. \nThe Navy will also be selling two Independence-class Littoral Combat Ships to foreign militaries due to a refocusing of the class on mine countermeasure missions. \nThe LCSs have been criticized for lacking armor, firepower, and redundancy, making them vulnerable to enemy attacks and accidents.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe U.S. Navy is decommissioning two nuclear aircraft carriers, the USS Nimitz and USS Eisenhower, as part of a long-term effort to modernize the current fleet.\nThe Nimitz and Eisenhower have both played significant roles in military conflicts and have a crew of about 6,000 personnel.\nAdditionally, two Independence-class Littoral Combat Ships will be sold to foreign militaries due to the Navy refocusing the class on mine countermeasure missions.\nThe LCSs have been criticized for their lack of armor, firepower, and redundancy."

        "text": "At the age of 15, I quickly began to realize I was different from everyone around me. Being born biologically male was always odd to me, as my innate femininity pulled me towards wanting to be a girl.  When I was a teenager there was such little education about gender and so few resources out there, I didn't know what this meant. I had never met a transgender person before.  But one night, in 2008, I found an article about a transgender girl. My mind was blown. I had no idea that was possible.  For the next 12 years, I buried my thoughts and feelings deep in my longing to transition.  I was so scared of how the world would treat me and that I would never find love. I settled into the ideology that I would forever be a feminine gay man and tried to move on with my life.  One morning, while working on a dance job abroad, I woke up feeling very strange. I hadn't thought about my gender dysphoria for such a long time that I believed I had finally moved past it—but when I opened my eyes, a thought flashed in my brain.  I am a trans woman and I have to do this now.  I couldn't continue living this lie as a man any longer. Over the coming months, I came out to my partner Liam, my family, and friends, all of whom were initially shocked, but supported me in my decision to transition to female.  I can honestly say, hand on heart, that transitioning is one of the most difficult things I have ever done—emotionally, mentally, physically, and financially.  Private healthcare for trans people is pricey. The pressure to choose a name, legally change everything about yourself, and find the courage to present yourself in a whole new way to the world, was terrifying.  Luckily for me, my close inner circle helped me so much along the way. I think I would have struggled to do it without them.  So much more goes into transition than you could realize, and it took me by surprise how I had to change everything in order to become who I was born to be.  Early on in my transition, I found public bathrooms a nightmare. For my sanity and to help the people around me with my transition, I didn't present myself differently straight away.  Over a period of six months, I gradually started showing more femininity, experimenting with clothing, hair, and makeup. Due to this slow transition, I had the most difficult time figuring out which bathroom to use.  Using the men's bathroom was something that always felt wrong to me, I felt so out of place and uncomfortable in there. Yet, I didn't feel I had the right to use the female bathroom as I was still presenting as very much male.  For a long time, I avoided public bathrooms as I didn't want to make myself uncomfortable and I didn't want to make other people feel uncomfortable. If I had to, I would use the disabled bathroom as this felt like my only option.  Only when I was dressing in full female clothing did I decide to use the female bathroom.  © Courtesy of Alexis Blake Alexis is pictured before her transition. Alexis is pictured before her transition. Courtesy of Alexis Blake  I was terrified of how I would be perceived in there; I felt like an imposter. I was now six months into the transition, my beard was getting lasered off, I was wearing long wigs and surgeries started to happen, but I still felt like I did not belong there.  Maybe it was my gender dysphoria rearing its ugly head, telling me I was not worthy of using a women's space.  I was amazed by women when I used the female bathroom. They could clearly see I was a transgender woman but they were so kind, always complimenting me and smiling my way.  Without these small acts of kindness I don't know how I would have continued to use these spaces.  Even now, nearly two years after transitioning, and as someone who for the most part \"passes\", so does not get noticed as a trans person anymore, I still sometimes feel like a fraud using the women's bathroom.  I recently came across an American trans woman on TikTok. She was explaining that if anyone tried to stop her from using the female bathroom, it would be the \"last mistake they ever make.\"  I was absolutely mortified to see this. The misogyny that was in her video was appalling. To no surprise, many women across the world were disgusted by this viral video.  The aggression and implication of violence in this video made me believe that this person does not belong in the female bathroom. As trans women, we are almost silently asking women if it's okay if we use female spaces.  These spaces are designed for biological women and I am well aware that being trans does not mean I fall under that category. I am more than comfortable saying I am a biological man.  © Courtesy of Alexis Blake Alexis told Newsweek about her transitioning journey. Alexis told Newsweek about her transitioning journey. Courtesy of Alexis Blake  I believe that the media, governments, and social media are pushing the agenda of some outrageous trans people, and giving their stories and videos the limelight. I believe they are pushing the views of these activists within the LGBT community, who I would consider extremists, to create a divide, uncertainty, and to make people skeptical of us. Then they can slowly bring in anti-trans laws which, we are already seeing happen.  I believe this rhetoric is so incredibly damaging to the trans community and all we fight for, because I feel it is beginning to make people turn on us.  In my eyes, we are at a crossroads now, where trans rights are hanging on by a thread and the extreme views some trans people have are not helping the current situation.  The trans debate is such a difficult one to have, but for me, transitioning from male to female was my only option to find true happiness.  I just want to exist in a world that sees me as equal to everyone else. I will always try to be respectful of others and ask for the same in return, especially when it comes to using female spaces.  Most trans people want to live ordinary lives, find love, go to work, and have families. These are the heroes we should champion and see dominating social media. Not the outspoken and aggressive people who I feel are currently dominating the media today.  I will continue to share my opinions on these topics on social media platforms like TikTok to keep the conversation growing, and to stand up for what I believe in.

        "text": "As Ukraine’s ‘shaping’ activities continue across Russian-occupied Ukraine—and parts of Russian territory—ahead of its much-anticipated counteroffensive, the global political environment is gradually, but significantly, shifting in Ukraine’s favour.  In the week leading up to this month’s G7 summit in Japan, and during the meeting itself, the symbolism and political decision-making surrounding Ukraine demonstrated more unified and unqualified support for President Volodymyr Zelensky, and may represent a turning point in the conflict.  Indeed, it may turn out to be the moment Ukraine won the war.  That has not always been the most likely outcome.  As Russia’s troops withdrew from around Kyiv six weeks after its unjustified but poorly planned invasion of Ukraine in February last year, it looked very much like Russia had lost the war, particularly in relation to its original aims of overrunning Kyiv and installing a Russia-friendly puppet regime.  However, since that time, and despite significant Ukrainian victories, including the retaking of vast swathes of territory in the Kharkiv region and Kherson city late last year, NATO governments have been focused primarily on ensuring that Ukraine is not overrun, rather than providing it with the tools and weapons to win the war.  The result has been a drip-feed of weapons, initially short-range missiles such as anti-tank Javelins that helped halt the Russian advance, and then eventually more substantial weapons such as HIMARS and missiles with a range of around 80 kilometres, Patriot air-defence systems and NATO main battle tanks.  However, while these weapons have been used effectively by Ukraine, at the moment they can’t be employed to attack Russian positions in Crimea, key supply routes or other targets deep behind enemy lines due to the longer distances involved.  The rationale for the frustratingly gradual rollout of long-range military hardware is NATO’s concern about Russian escalation, potentially through nuclear weapons. Initially, at least, there was also the desire for an ‘exit ramp through diplomatic means’ for Russian President Vladimir Putin, which culminated in French President Emmanuel Macron’s statement in June last year that ‘we must not humiliate Russia’. Ukraine was understandably furious about that remark and the general hesitancy of NATO to supply long-range weapons, which ensured it was fighting with one hand tied behind its back. But NATO has now substantially shifted its approach.  The first inkling that major NATO members had revised their risk assessment of Russian escalation was the confirmation on 11 May that the UK was supplying Ukraine with Storm Shadow cruise missiles, with a range of around 250 kilometres. Missile strikes in Luhansk a few days later made it clear that this had significantly altered calculations regarding the war: targets deep in Russian-held territory were now in the crosshairs.  Meanwhile, Germany announced a significant new €2.7 billion (A$4.43 billion) package of military aid to Ukraine as Zelensky undertook a whirlwind tour of European allies including Germany, France, Italy and the UK. He then travelled to Saudi Arabia to address an Arab League summit, a grouping generally notable for their neutrality in the conflict.  The potential coup de grâce came, however, on the final leg of the tour when Zelensky attended the G7 summit in Hiroshima.  In addition to Zelensky being feted as a guest of honour, in the company of President Joe Biden and other world leaders, the sense that support for Ukraine was widening and hardening came with the announcement that the US would train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 fighter jets and allow NATO allies to supply Ukraine with American-made F-16s.  This decision by the US was the first that supplies NATO-made warplanes to Ukraine and is likely to be a game-changer. The fourth-generation F-16s have some technical shortcomings against fifth-generation Russian jets, but they will go a long way towards levelling the playing field in the air. F-16s will provide Ukraine’s air force with much greater vision and capability against Russian warplanes and will deliver much better air support for ground forces.  Beyond the military benefits of the planes, it is the shift in rhetoric and policy from NATO partners that will likely have the greatest effect on the outcome of the war.  That shift was underscored in US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s comments during the G7: ‘We have not placed limitations on Ukraine being able to strike on its territory within its internationally recognised borders … And we believe Crimea is Ukraine.’  This is the first time that NATO and the Biden administration have clearly given Ukraine the green light to use NATO weapons in its attempt to take back all of its territory, including Crimea. The supply of Storm Shadow missiles by the UK reinforced this approach, and has made the potential US supply of long-range ATACMS less contentious, since their ranges are similar.  Ukraine will probably have the F-16s ready for deployment later in the northern autumn, which would allow them to be used to reinforce any gains achieved in the coming counteroffensive.  In any case, it’s now clear not just that Putin and Russia have lost this war, but that Ukraine could actually win, with the prospect of regaining all of its territory, including that which it lost in 2014.  This was unthinkable until quite recently. NATO appears no longer concerned that escalation is likely. In Hiroshima, Biden openly mocked the Russians. Asked for his response to the Kremlin arguing that the supply of F-16s was a ‘colossal risk’, he replied: ‘It is, for them’.  There’s a long way to go in this war, and there’s no guarantee that Putin, having made the terrible decision to invade in the first place, won’t make another terrible decision in escalating the conflict.  However, it’s now clear from recent NATO policy and rhetoric that by the time the next US president comes to power, whether Democrat or Republican, the main phase of the conflict may well be over. A steady supply of F-16s, long-range missiles and other modern NATO materiel this year and next should ensure that Ukraine has the best opportunity to regain control of large swathes, if not all, of its legitimate territory.

(Juan Alberto VÃ¡zquez/Luces de Nueva York via Storyful)  Â© Provided by Yahoo News US  A man who was acting âerraticallyâ on a New York City subway is dead after another passenger put him in a chokehold, police and witnesses say.  The New York City medical examiner determined that Jordan Neely, 30, died from compression of the neck, the Associated Press reported.  Hereâs everything we know about the deadly encounter, culled from original reporting and trusted partners, including the New York Daily News, CBS News and others.  How it unfolded  Â© Provided by Yahoo News A man who was reportedly behaving \"erratically\" is restrained by a chokehold. (Juan Alberto VÃ¡zquez/Luces de Nueva York via Storyful)  According to the Daily News, the incident began around 2:30 p.m. on Monday when a man identified as Neely, who âused to busk in the subway as a Michael Jackson impersonator,â was on an uptown F train when he began yelling and screaming, passengers told police.  Neely âyelled and threw garbage at commuters,â prompting another man, identified as a 24-year-old Marine veteran, to intervene.  âI donât have food, I donât have to drink, Iâm fed up,â Neely screamed, according to Juan Alberto VÃ¡zquez, a freelance journalist and fellow passenger. âI donât mind going to jail and getting life in prison. Iâm ready to die.â  Video shows chokehold  Â© Provided by Yahoo News Juan Alberto VÃ¡zquez/Luces de Nueva York via Storyful  Video footage of the encounter taken by VÃ¡zquez and posted to Facebook shows Neely, who was Black, flailing his arms as he is restrained in a chokehold by the veteran, who is white. Two other men are seen standing over Neely in the three-minute video, pushing his arms away as he remains in the chokehold.  The three men then let go of Neely, who is seen lying motionless on the floor of the train.  According to VÃ¡zquez, Neely was in the chokehold for nearly 15 minutes before he lost consciousness.  \"I witnessed a murder on the Manhattan subway today,\" VÃ¡zquez wrote on Facebook.  When police arrived, Neely was unresponsive and first responders were unable to revive him. He was then taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  The 24-year-old was taken in for questioning and released.  Whatâs next?  Â© Provided by Yahoo News Video footage shows a man flailing his arms as he is restrained. (Juan Alberto VÃ¡zquez/Luces de Nueva York via Storyful)  Homeless advocates are calling for a thorough investigation of Neely's death.  In a statement, Dave Giffen, executive director of Coalition for the Homeless, said that âthis horrific incident is yet another reminderâ of the âcomplete failure [by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams] to provide the critical mental health services desperately needed by so many people in our city.â  âWhatâs more, the fact that someone who took the life of a distressed, mentally-ill human being on a subway could be set free without facing any consequences is shocking,â Giffen added, âand evidences the Cityâs callous indifference to the lives of those who are homeless and psychiatrically unwell. This is an absolute travesty that must be investigated immediately.â  Statistically speaking, though, crime in New York City is actually on the decline.

Raoul released the results of a sweeping investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in the state on Tuesday. (Eileen T. Meslar/Chicago Tribune via AP) ( (Eileen T. Meslar / Associated Press)  More than 450 Catholic clergy in Illinois sexually abused nearly 2,000 children since 1950, the state’s attorney general found in an investigation released Tuesday, revealing that the problem was far worse than the church had let on.  Attorney General Kwame Raoul said at a news conference that investigators found that 451 Catholic clergy abused 1,997 children in Illinois between 1950 and 2019, though he acknowledged that the statute of limitations has expired in many cases and that those abusers “will never see justice in a legal sense.”  “It is my hope that this report will shine light both on those who violated their positions of power and trust to abuse innocent children, and on the men in church leadership who covered up that abuse,” Raoul said, crediting the accusers for making the review possible. “These perpetrators may never be held accountable in a court of law, but by naming them here, the intention is to provide a public accountability and a measure of healing to survivors who have long suffered in silence.”  The review began in 2018 under Raoul's predecessor, Lisa Madigan, who released a blistering report as she prepared to leave office. Raoul continued the investigation, and he said Tuesday that 25 staff members reviewed more than 100,000 pages of diocesan documents and engaged in more than 600 confidential interactions with contacts.  The lengthy report describes Illinois church leaders as woefully slow to acknowledge the extent of the abuse. It also accuses them of frequently dragging their feet to confront accused clergy and of failing to warn parishioners about possible abusers in their midst, sometimes even decades after allegations emerged.  In a joint statement issued Friday ahead of Raoul’s announcement, the state’s Catholic dioceses said the attorney general’s investigation prompted a yearslong review of their policies and unspecified changes. Cardinal Blase Cupich, archbishop of Chicago, on Monday called abuse “repugnant” but said the church in 1992 began overhauling its policies and programs and cooperated fully with the state’s review.  “My hope is that the release of this report will be an occasion for the attorney general to issue a rallying cry to all adults to join in the work of safeguarding children, lest this moment be a lost opportunity,” Cupich said. “I stand ready to continue to do my part.”  Much of the report is dedicated to individual accounts of sexual abuse and lists of clergy and religious brothers in each diocese accused of child sexual abuse. Some of those named have become infamous due to criminal proceedings or lawsuits, including Father Daniel McCormack, who was the subject of more than 100 abuse claims in the decades before his 2006 arrest for abusing five boys in Chicago.  He later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison.  Even after McCormack's first arrest in 2005 for sexual abuse, the Chicago archdiocese did not remove him from the ministry since those charges were dropped for a lack of evidence, the report says. An archdiocese review board recommended McCormack's removal that year, but then-Cardinal Francis George declined.  According to the report, the mother of one of McCormack’s victims later said: “If Cardinal George (had) done the right thing, these other boys would not have been molested. (Instead), he just opened the door for (McCormack) to take advantage of other Black children.”  Many of the accounts contained in the report have remained private for decades. It includes the account of Bob Corcoran, who reported that Father Thomas Considine, who was a teacher at a high school in Elgin, repeatedly sexually abused Corcoran in the 1970s. Considine was removed from ministry in 1980 for undetermined reasons and died in 1988, the report states.  Corcoran told state investigators that he reported the abuse to the Rockford diocese in 2011 and that the church eventually determined his claims couldn't be proven or disproven. He asked that Raoul's office include his name in its final report and said the document's release provided a sense of relief.  “To see the light at the end of the tunnel, and there is no longer a freight train racing towards me, is freeing,” Corcoran said in a statement released by his attorneys. \"We all need to do our part in bringing resolution to the most vulnerable – children like you and me.”  In a statement released Tuesday, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests called the report “stunning” but emphasized that the numbers of victims and abusers cited by Raoul are likely undercounted. The group also called on state and local officials to conduct similar reviews.  “There is no questioning the facts of the report — until 2018 when the investigation began, hierarchs in every Illinois diocese kept known abusers under wraps, declined to include them on their accused lists, and refused to acknowledge the truth that survivors of abuse who came forward to make a report shared with them,” the group said.  Similar government-led investigations detailing reports of clergy sexual abuse and church leaders’ failure to hold perpetrators accountable have rocked archdioceses in other states, including Pennsylvania and Maryland.  The Catholic Conference of Illinois says 3.5 million Catholics make up approximately 27% of Illinois’ total population, and that the Church maintains 949 parishes and has 2,215 priests, 1,372 deacons, and 260 religious brothers.  Accusers and activists for years have complained that abusers belonging to orders have often been able to avoid the scrutiny other clergy received because of their semi-autonomy from archdioceses. The new report, however, officially names some former clergy tied to such orders.  Among those listed is Bruce Wellems, a former priest with the Claretians missionaries assigned for years to Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago. His accuser says Wellems sexually abused him more than a dozen times starting in 1973 when they were neighbors in New Mexico. The accuser was in the second grade and Wellems was in high school. Wellems admitted in a 2014 interview with The Associated Press that he had inappropriately touched the boy, but he said he never again abused a child.  ___  This story was updated to correct instances in which Daniel McCormack's name was misspelled “McCormick.”  ___  Find more AP coverage of the church sexual abuse scandal: https://apnews.com/hub/sexual-abuse-by-clergy.

The speaker was light on specific details regarding the bill, instead calling it \"an agreement in principle that's worthy of the American people.\" \"It has historically reductions in spending, consequential reforms that will lift people out of poverty into the workforce, reign in government overreach. There are no new taxes, no government programs,\" McCarthy said. The agreement is a two-year budget deal that would also separately raise the debt limit for two years, sources familiar with the negotiations told ABC News. Sources said the budget deal would keep non-defense spending roughly flat with current levels in fiscal year 2024, increasing by 1% in 2025. One source said the negotiating team is now working on finalizing bill text and a term sheet. House Democrats are invited to a members-only White House briefing on Sunday at 5 p.m., per one source. The agreement phases in new work requirements for recipients of SNAP benefits -- specifically time limits on the benefits for people up to age 54, excluding veterans and homeless people. Those new requirements would sunset in 2030, sources said. There are no changes to Medicaid requirements, sources added. The agreement also fully funds medical care for veterans, including an extension of funding in the PACT Act, one source said. And it would streamline the review process for certain energy projects. © Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting on the debt ceiling with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), not pictured, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on May 22, 2023. President Joe Biden issued a statement on the agreement in principle, calling it \"an important step forward\" and a \"compromise\" as the White House and Congress continue to finalize the text of the bill. \"It is an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting critical programs for working people and growing the economy for everyone. And, the agreement protects my and Congressional Democrats’ key priorities and legislative accomplishments,\" Biden said. \"The agreement represents a compromise, which means not everyone gets what they want. That’s the responsibility of governing,\" he said. Biden said the deal will prevent \"what could have been a catastrophic default and would have led to an economic recession, retirement accounts devastated, and millions of jobs lost\" -- though the deal will have to pass both chambers of Congress and get to his desk by June 5 to do so. Given the tight timeline, Biden said work would continue between both sides and \"I strongly urge both chambers to pass the agreement right away.\" The breakthrough on the government's debt and spending comes just days before the so-called \"X-date\" when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the U.S. would run out of cash to pay all of its bills on time. A tentative deal will have to pass the Republican-controlled House and Democrat-controlled Senate. Time is of the essence to push the deal through before potential default. McCarthy has pledged to give House members 72 hours to review the legislation before a vote. And in the Senate, it would only take one lawmaker to possibly delay approval for up to a week. Wings from both parties expressed dissatisfaction during talks and encouraged their respective leaders to stand their ground. The House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative hardliners who held up McCarthy's ascension to the speakership, signaled opposition to anything other than the Limit, Save, Grow Act passed in the House last month and said a major overhaul of the government's spending is needed. On the other side of the aisle, several progressive Democrats warned they would push back on any deal that gave too many concessions to Republicans, arguing that negotiating on the budget with default looming amounted to economic hostage-taking by the GOP. © Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images House Speaker Kevin McCarthy listens as President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting on the debt ceiling, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, May 22, 2023. The fight over the debt ceiling has threatened to sink the economy. Economists have warned the U.S. being unable to fulfill financial obligations would put millions of jobs at risk, increase unemployment levels and lead to higher prices for everyday items. A default could also result in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid payments -- as well as military pay and veterans benefits -- going unpaid or being delayed. As the negotiations came down to the wire, Americans who depend on those checks expressed growing concern and anxiety surrounding their ability to pay rent, buy groceries and other daily expenses if default were to occur. Air Force veteran Jacob Thomas in Minneapolis told ABC News' Elizabeth Schulze the uncertainty over default was already hitting American military families. \"Even if a deal is reached, everything winds up being okay next week, that still means that right now, families and veterans across the country are having to think about what does it mean for me to have to ration my current paycheck or my current disability paycheck,\" Thomas said.

        "text": "WASHINGTON – Republican attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris are taking hold, and the White House is running out of time to reframe the narrative, Democrats say.  At a meeting two days after President Joe Biden announced his 2024 reelection bid, a group of Democratic strategists told the White House as much during a briefing for television pundits on the pair’s agenda.  For more than two years, Republicans had been trying to paint Harris as incompetent. And yet, the strategists found, the White House was still developing its strategy for how to combat the ruthless assault against the first Black and Asian American woman to hold the vice presidency.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  A discussion ensued about ways to lift up Harris and improve her image, four participants in the meeting said. Democrats in the room argued that Harris would benefit from more public appearances in environments where she can be herself and in front of voting groups with whom she is already popular.  Biden has since made a visible show of support for Harris, defending her in an interview and playing up an unannounced visit the pair made to a Mexican restaurant on Cinco de Mayo.  But some Harris allies fear it’s too late. The vice president’s poll numbers have been below 50% since the duo’s first year in office, and several Democrats, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, expressed concern that they may be beyond repair.  Views about Harris, a former California attorney general who briefly ran for president and served a partial term in the U.S. Senate, may be hardening, and some Democrats say Biden’s team did not take that seriously fast enough.  In a CBS News poll late last month, Harris had a 43% approval rating and a 57% disapproval rating. Although she has wide Democratic support, Harris is viewed favorably by just 35% of swing voters.  Harris’ negatives rose early in the administration after she was tasked with leading an effort to stem the tide of illegal migration to the U.S. from Central American nations. The assignment led to a barrage of attacks from Republicans, who sought to make her the face of the border crisis.  In the past year, Harris has found a niche in promoting abortion rights, railing against the Supreme Court decision that gave states the ability to ban the practice.  “It has helped the vice president focus on a single issue that she talks about repeatedly,” said Jamal Simmons, a former communications director to Harris who departed the White House in January. “She continues to have 10 or 12 issues that she cares about and focuses on and pop up. This issue of reproductive freedom is one that is not going away.”  GOP attacks intensify on Harris  The attacks on Harris are not a new phenomenon. But with the presidential campaign underway, Republicans’ focus on the vice president has intensified.  GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley suggested last month that Biden, who is 80, would not live through the end of a second term.  Last week, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador wrote in a Fox News op-ed that Harris, 58, is “one of the most incompetent elected officials in the country.\"  Rep. Jim Clyburn, a national co-chair of Biden’s reelection campaign, said the White House should not “stoop that low” and take the bait.  “That kind of lowlife stuff, they ought not respond to,” Clyburn, D-S.C., said in an interview.  © MANDEL NGAN, AFP via Getty Images Vice President Kamala Harris shops at Home Rule Records with owner Charvis Campbell in Washington, DC, on May 3, 2023.  He tied the attacks that are meant to discredit Harris to the period after the Civil War, known as the Reconstruction era, and said discrimination against Black officeholders and anti-democratic events such as the Jan 6. insurrection will continue if they are left unchecked.  Patrick Gaspard, an Obama-era official who was executive director of the Democratic National Committee, said he believes Americans are not yet paying close attention to the 2024 race. “There isn't anyone in that White House from the president on down who can be shook by this at all,” said Gaspard, referring to the criticism of Harris.  The White House knows that attacking the vice president as a means of undercutting the ticket is part of an old political playbook, which Biden himself is familiar with after running for reelection alongside President Barack Obama, he said. And most voters will be concerned about near-term challenges, including the economy and their personal rights, Gaspard added.  Rallying the Democratic base  Staunch backers of Harris say that with the right approach, the vice president can still build on her support. In a Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll from mid-December, nearly 11% of voters said they were undecided about Harris.  “What will help her numbers go up is when they begin conducting a paid advertising campaign that extols the work she’s been doing the last two years,” said Simmons, the former Harris aide.  Harris’ allies say questions about who the vice president is and what she has accomplished stem from a lack of familiarity with her background and record that was exacerbated by the constraints on holding in-person events during the COVID-19 pandemic.  “I just think that Vice President Harris hasn't gotten the credit she deserves,” Biden said in an MSNBC interview that aired this past Friday. “She is really very, very good. And with everything going on, she hasn't gotten the attention she deserves.”  © Evan Vucci, AP President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris smile during a meeting with his \"Investing in America Cabinet,\" in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Friday, May 5, 2023, in Washington. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona appears on a screen as he attends the meeting virtually. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) ORG XMIT: DCEV420  The recent addition of Stephanie Young, a senior adviser who’s focused on communications, was viewed by Democrats with close ties to the White House as a step toward bolstering Harris' image. She came to the vice president’s shop from When We All Vote, an organization founded by former first lady Michelle Obama.  Young delivered the section of the presentation that pertained to Harris during the meeting with Democratic pundits and strategists alongside Harris press secretary Kirsten Allen.  “The meeting was an opportunity to share more about the Administration’s work overall. It also served as an opportunity to share the Vice President’s work and ensure the leading voices communicating with the American people were fully aware of what the Vice President is doing on the American people’s behalf. It was a two way conversation to increase understanding and connection,” a White House official who declined to be named said in a statement to USA TODAY.  The official emphasized Harris’ work on abortion rights, gun violence prevention and infrastructure projects and said the vice president would be “out and in the fight” over those issues in the weeks and months ahead.  Democrats said they expect the White House to strategically deploy Harris to rally base voters, much as it did in the 2022 midterms – putting her in front of audiences with whom she's popular. The vice president has relatively high approval ratings with Black voters, registered Democrats and voters under 30, in particular.  Harris’ trip to Tennessee last month, where she spoke to students at a historically Black university and met with three state legislators who were ejected from office, was among public appearances that White House allies praised.  Harris symbolizes to a diverse generation of younger voters what is possible in America, said Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of the progressive youth advocacy group NextGen America.  And having the vice president out on the campaign trail making the case for another four years to Gen Z voters would be “really smart on their part,” she said. “There is a lot that they can talk about about what they've done, and not just pointing to the other side and how bad the other side is.”  This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Democrats want to fix Kamala Harris' image problem.

They got their wish when I went to Stanford University and then the University of California at San Francisco’s medical school, both fully integrated and welcoming. Before they passed away, they firmly believed that the era of separating people by race was over forever. © Provided by FOX News My parents were wrong. Higher education is deliberately re-segregating, driven by race-obsessed activists who, bizarrely, claim to oppose \"systemic racism.\" Universities like Harvard and Chicago have held Black-only graduation ceremonies in recent years. WOKE DOCTORS BLAST 'CORRUPTED' MEDICAL SCHOOLS FOR REJECTING STUDENTS ON MCAT AND GPA SCORES: ‘INSIGNIFICANT' And in recent weeks, America’s most prestigious medical journal published a now infamous article calling for separating the races into different groups – based on a pilot program at my own alma mater. This is easily the greatest regression in civil rights in my lifetime, bringing back the very evil my parents endured and dreaded. The new article, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is brazen in its defense of racial segregation. At the UCSF medical school, people of different races were separated into so-called \"affinity groups,\" which met regularly and supplemented the school’s actual curriculum. READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP Supposedly, these groups benefit Blacks, giving us a place for \"expressing … a full range of emotions.\" White groups, meanwhile, apparently provide a place to be \"held accountable\" and \"learn to be thoughtful allies.\" According to this argument, everyone is made stronger when no one mixes together. My parents were familiar with the argument that segregation was good for all – Black, White, you name it. That was false 100 years ago, and it’s still false now. That’s especially true when you look at the rationale behind this new segregation. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, medical schools are \"retraumatizing, resulting in imposter syndrome, heightened anxiety, and a reduced sense of belonging\" for Blacks like me, requiring segregated \"approaches\" that ostensibly work better for us. This is blatant racism. It implies that Blacks can’t deal with the rigors of medical education because of our skin color. And it holds that we need to be shoved into our own group – let’s call it \"separate but equal\" – if we hope to succeed. Hogwash. Clearly, Black medical students can succeed just fine without being segregated. I prove it. So do countless others, going back decades. It’s bad enough that demanding segregation passes for medical expertise these days. Yet what’s infinitely worse is what will happen as segregation returns. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It’s already happening, and not just at my alma mater. The UMass Chan Medical School has created segregated affinity groups, too, and the day is coming when every medical school will do the same, to say nothing of the rest of higher education. Black students are already being told to form their own groups and hold their own graduation ceremonies. What’s next, encouraging them to work in Black-only hospitals, live in Black-only neighborhoods, and send their kids to Black-only schools? No one would ever say Whites should do any of that, so why is it acceptable to push Blacks into our own separate corner? This sick turn of events is especially galling in medical education. Our profession has proven, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that every person is equal, since we’re all the same on the inside. Yet now future physicians are being taught to view people differently, and worse, as potential threats to their emotional and even physical well-being. They’re being told to view each other as just that – \"other.\" It’s not long before you start to see each other as not merely different, but lesser, and eventually, as less than human. The people pushing this madness are right about one thing: Systemic racism is real. They’re proving it, by bringing back racial segregation into the higher education system. My parents saw it end once, sending me to schools where everyone was equal and civil rights were respected. Nothing could be worse than subjecting our children and grandchildren to the evil of segregation all over again.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThis article discusses the recent push for racial segregation in higher education, which the author believes is a regression in civil rights.\nThe author argues that this segregation is based on racism, as it implies that Black students cannot handle the rigors of medical education without being separated from other races.\nThe author believes that this segregation is a form of systemic racism and will lead to people viewing each other as lesser and eventually, as less than human.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nUniversities like Harvard and Chicago have held Black-only graduation ceremonies in recent years.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine recently published an article calling for separating the races into different groups.\nThis new segregation implies that Blacks can’t deal with the rigors of medical education because of their skin color.\nSystemic racism is being perpetuated by bringing back racial segregation into the higher education system."

        "text": "© Provided by News Nation  “Dateline NBC” reported the new information Friday night about Bryan Kohberger, who has been charged with four counts of murder in the November slayings of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves. According to Dateline, Kohberger befriended a woman at Washington State University, which he attended and worked at, and broke into her property months before the killings and moved things around but did not steal anything. The woman, who was not identified, then allegedly asked Kohberger to come over to assist her, and that’s when he suggested she get security cameras. Dateline reports he offered to install them, to which she agreed. Authorities believe he could have accessed the footage remotely because he knew her Wi-Fi password. Kohberger is scheduled to be arraigned Monday after a grand jury indicted him on four counts of murder and one count of burglary in connection with the University of Idaho students’ killings. Prosecutors allege he stabbed them all to death in the early morning hours of Nov. 13. Information in an arrest affidavit says cellphone tower data shows him in the area of the house where they were killed multiple times in the days and weeks leading up to the killings. Prosecutors also allege that a period of inactivity on his cellphone shows an attempt to conceal his movements at the time of the killings. Prosecutors allege Kohberger’s DNA was found on a knife sheath left at the crime scene. According to Dateline, Kohberger reportedly bought a KA-BAR knife and sheath in April 2022 from Amazon before he moved to Pullman, Washington, to attend university. Kohberger was arrested some six weeks after killings at his parents’ home in Pennsylvania. Police seized items including clothing, medical gloves, and a cheek swab for DNA collection. The warrant also shows Kohberger was being surveilled while in Pennsylvania and was tracked using his cellphone.

        "text": "Russia’s air force may have just suffered one of its worst days since the Ukraine war began. Unconfirmed reports say that four of its aircraft were shot down within Russian territory, in what would mark a significant coup for Ukraine.  There are conflicting accounts about how many planes and helicopters may have been brought down inside the Russian region of Bryansk, but one Russian media outlet says that at least two combat aircraft – an Su-34 and an Su-35 – and two Mi-8 helicopters crashed.  © Provided by CNN A file image of a Russian Air Force Mil Mi-8 attack helicopter, the type of which was reportedly shot down. - Leonid Faerberg/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images  Ukraine has not confirmed its air defenses were involved in the reported downing of the Russian aircraft on Saturday, but says the aircraft “ran into some trouble.”  Bryansk is on the border with Ukraine and has seen previous attacks blamed on Kyiv.  Multiple crashes within Russian territory at the same time would be unprecedented. Some analysts believe Ukrainian air defenses may have been pushed forward as the Russian air force uses more “glide munitions” that can fire at targets from distance.  The Ukrainian air force spokesman, Yuriy Ihnat, said Sunday that a Russian “strike air group attacked Ukraine from the north, from Bryansk Oblast. They do this almost every day. They carry out strikes with guided bombs.”  In this instance, he said, “they ran into some trouble. They wanted to bomb our civilians, our peaceful people.” He went on to call it a “black day” for Russian aviation.  Social media videos geolocated by CNN show at least one helicopter crashing near the town of Klintsy in Bryansk, which is 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border.  Aleksandr Bogomaz, the Governor of Bryansk, confirmed that a helicopter had crashed, injuring one civilian, but gave no details on the cause.  Another video, showing an aircraft coming down and a column of black smoke, has been geolocated to a village in Bryansk some 25 kilometers from Klintsy.  The official Russian news agency TASS published video of one helicopter exploding in mid-air and confirmed that an Su-34 fighter had crashed, without indicating the cause.  ‘Complete idiocy’  There’s been no word from the Russian Defense Ministry on the incident, but one unofficial Russian Telegram channel described it as the worst day for Russian military aviation since March last year.  The Russian newspaper Kommersant said that “a group of two Mi-8 helicopters and Su-34 and Su-35 fighters crashed in the Bryansk Oblast,” and suggested more helicopters might have been hit.  It added: “The attackers are being sought on the ground and in the air.”  Kommersant reported that the “fighters were to carry out a missile-bombing strike on targets in the Chernihiv Region of Ukraine, while the helicopters were to back them up, including to pick up the Su crews if they were shot down by enemy fire. All four machines did not return to the airfield. Their pilots were killed.”  The Kommersant report cannot be independently verified. But other Russian sources have begun discussing the incident, with one popular Telegram channel that posts about the conflict saying: “We are talking about a carefully planned [Ukrainian] operation here.”  © Provided by CNN Smoke rises after a SU-34 warplane crashed in Bryansk, Russia on May 13. - kommersant/Telegram  Andrei Medvedev, a deputy on Moscow city council, said Saturday four aircraft had been lost and added: “Luhansk yesterday [a reference to missile strikes on the city], a strike on our air force today. Probing the defenses. Where it breaks. And strikes on the rear, infrastructure, and aviation.”  Another Russian Telegram channel that posts daily about the conflict claimed the Ukrainians were “launching rockets from the Chernihiv region, coming almost to the very border.”  Daniil Bezsonov, a Russian military blogger, posted Saturday that “The enemy most likely acted from an ambush by its air defense forces, which had moved into the border zone in advance, from which the distance would allow our air group to be hit. So the enemy most likely knew the route and time of our air group’s departure.”  There was also consternation among Russian bloggers that one Mi-8 helcopter shot down had advanced jamming equipment.  One Russian Telegram account said it was “complete idiocy” to send such a helicopter so close to Ukrainian defenses, saying “you had to be completely detached from reality” to send the specially-equipped Mi-8s into such a zone.  Military analysts assess that Ukraine may have pushed its air defenses forward to the border in regions such as Chernihiv to combat the Russians’ growing use of bombs that can be launched from distance, almost acting as a missile.  Ihnat said last month that the Russian military was converting FAB-500 high-explosive aerial bombs into cruise missiles. They are using these bombs “from a distance that is unreachable for Ukrainian air defense,” he said.  Mykola Oleshchuk, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, has also suggested that the nature of the threat has changed.  “The planes of the Russians do not enter the zone of damage of our air defenses, striking remotely at the front line and near-frontline cities,” he said on Telegram in April.  Saturday’s events in Bryansk suggest that zone may now have been expanded into Russian territory.  It also suggests – as a number of unofficial Russian sources have pointed out – that Ukraine in this case possessed detailed intelligence about the planned Russian mission. That may be as of much concern in Russia as the loss of four aircraft over Russian territory  For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThe Russian air force may have suffered one of its worst days since the Ukraine war began, with reports of four aircraft being shot down within Russian territory.\nUkraine has not confirmed its air defenses were involved, but says the aircraft “ran into some trouble.” Social media videos show at least one helicopter crashing near the town of Klintsy in Bryansk, and another video showing an aircraft coming down and a column of black smoke has been geolocated to a village in Bryansk.\nUnofficial Russian sources suggest Ukraine may have pushed its air defenses forward to the border and had detailed intelligence about the planned Russian mission.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nUnconfirmed reports say that four Russian aircraft were shot down within Russian territory. \nUkraine has not confirmed its air defenses were involved, but says the aircraft “ran into some trouble.” \nUkraine may have pushed its air defenses forward to the border to combat the Russians’ growing use of bombs that can be launched from distance. \nUkraine in this case possessed detailed intelligence about the planned Russian mission."

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 Donald Trump  To say that Donald J. Trump was the most persecuted president in modern American history is an understatement.  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  As it turns out, the US intelligence community (IC) was weaponized against him by Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, at the behest of Trump’s 2016 rival for president.  Claims that Trump was a Russian agent of influence were totally fabricated and were used as the basis for an endless war waged upon both Trump’s reputation and his presidency as a way to prevent Trump and the Republican Party from solidifying what should have been the most successful Republican presidency since the Reagan Administration.  Trump’s Sins  At the same time, however, Trump was far from a saint.  Long a fixture of the cutthroat Manhattan real estate scene as well as a top celebrity with bestselling books and a highly popular reality television series on NBC, Trump courted controversy at every turn in his long, public career.  It was what helped to catapult him to fame—and that fame was essential for his inevitable rise as America’s forty-fifth president.  Once in office, Trump could not prevent himself from continuing to court controversy. In fact, he tended to inflame existing political divides on his own and militated many important independent voters as well as political and business elites that he needed to stay on his side.  Even with all the investigations into Trump based on fabricated evidence, despite Trump’s various failures as president, Trump was coasting to reelection at the start of 2020. This was because the economy was going gangbusters under Trump’s stewardship.  The fact that so many Americans were doing so well materially during Trump’s presidency stunted whatever dislike the forty-fifth president may have engendered.  That all changed, though, with the arrival of COVID-19 on America’s shores. Trump mismanaged the greatest crisis in his presidency. The worst aspects of his personality were highlighted for all to see—with devastating effects on our country.  Once the Trump Administration implemented the national shutdowns, the economy collapsed. Trump’s greatest selling point for why he should have been reelected was erased.  This is why “Sleepy” Joe Biden, a man who had twice before run for the presidency and barely made it beyond the first round of the Democratic Party primary each time, suddenly became competitive against Trump.  As the 2020 election dragged on, Trump became viewed by far too many voters as unworthy of the presidency.  Once he lost the election, rather than admit defeat, and work to rebuild his brand and reputation so that he could more effectively run again in 2024 as the undisputed GOP nominee, Trump spent his final months in office engaged in increasingly desperate—and dangerous—attempts to overturn the election.  More than 40 legal challenges were mounted by the Trump Campaign in various courts around the country (with many of the presiding judges in those cases being Trump appointees or friendly Republicans).  None managed to secure for Trump the overturning he needed…because his legal team lacked the evidence to prove that the 2020 election was stolen by the Democrats.  Rather than walk away after the bulk of those cases could not be decided in Trump’s favor, he kept doubling-down on his unprovable claims. Trump refused to place the needs of the country ahead of his own wounded ego.  Ultimately, elements loyal to Trump would participate in the terrible January 6 riot. But even before that sad day, Trump interfered in the then-ongoing Georgia recount.  Donald Trump Needed 11,780 Votes…  Because his campaign had challenged the results of the Georgia election, the state initiated three different recounts.  During the final recount, Trump called down to Georgia’s Republican secretary of state (who was overseeing the recount), Brad Raffensperger, and demanded that he find for Trump 11,780 votes—enough to swing Georgia back to the Republican camp, and ensure Trump won that critical state.  To compound Mr. Trump’s problems, Raffensperger, who had been under increasing pressure from Trump to illegally sway the recount in Trump’s favor, recorded the conversation. That recording became the basis of a serious grand jury investigation into whether or not Trump’s recorded comments constituted election interference.  Given the nature of the comments and the fact that Trump was the most powerful political figure in the US federal government at the time of that conversation with Raffensperger, there is likely a strong case to be made.  In fact, it is believed that the attorney leading the Atlanta-based grand jury investigation into the Georgia election fraud claims is about hand out indictments as soon as August of this year. Should that occur, that will be Trump’s second major indictment this year and his third bad showing in a major legal proceeding.  Trump’s Massive Legal Woes  Trump’s previous indictment was for the Manhattan DA’s politically motivated investigation into alleged hush money payments Trump had made to pornographic actress, Stormy Daniels. His next trial date in that case is for early December. Trump’s other terrible showing in court derives from the civil suit that journalist E. Jean Carroll filed against Trump for purportedly raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the early 1990s. Trump was not found guilty of rape. Instead, the New York jury found Trump guilty of sexual assault—battery—and defamation.  Each one of these cases increases Trump’s popularity with Republican primary voters and radically lowers his popularity with the kind of independent voters who will likely determine the 2024 Presidential Election. In the case of the election fraud investigation in Georgia, Trump has little recourse.  The recording of his own words will be damning enough. It is yet another reminder that, no matter how unfairly Trump was treated by the power elite in America since he first announced his candidacy for president in 2016, the forty-fifth president is his own worst enemy.  Trump’s Motivations  Trump’s legal team will have a herculean task in the Georgia case: proving that Donald Trump truly believed that the election in 2020 was stolen.  Rather than perpetrating fraud, then, the case could be made that the former president was engaged in what he believed at the time was a genuine defense of the election.  Yet, there is eyewitness testimony that the January 6 Committee in Congress recorded in which members of Trump’s inner circle shared that Trump admitted to them immediately following the November 2020 election decision that he had, in fact, lost the 2020 election.  In order to disprove that eyewitness testimony, Trump will have to either take the stand or provide alternative evidence refuting the claims of the witnesses who spoke under oath to Congress during the January 6 Committee hearings.  What’s more, Trump would have to make a variation of the insanity defense—that he was detached from reality—which might get him out of the legal trouble he’s in with that particular case, but would certainly set Trump up for some political problems if he went on to battle Joe Biden for the presidency in 2024.  In other words, Trump is under serious legal threat from the election fraud case in Georgia.  At this rate, it should be clear that the only reason Trump is really running for reelection is not to save America. That’s, at best, an ancillary concern for him.  Instead, he is running to repair his wounded pride for having lost to such a terrible candidate, Joe Biden, and he is campaigning to be president so that he can inevitably pardon himself for whatever crimes he is being indicted for at present.  These should not be acceptable motivations for running for the highest office in our land. How can we trust his judgment, if all he cares about is saving himself?  What about We, The People?

        "text": "© Getty U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), Vice Chairwoman of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, delivers remarks during the last public meeting in the Canon House Office Building on Capitol Hill on December 19, 2022 in Washington, DC. Cheney recently gave a commencement speech at her alma mater Colorado College, and many students booed her and turned their chairs around so their backs faced her while she spoke.  Former Representative Liz Cheney didn't have the warmest welcome when she traveled to Colorado College to give a commencement address to her alma mater on Sunday.  Cheney, who was ousted from her Wyoming seat in August after a tumultuous few years in Congress, has lost a lot of support from the Republican Party for openly criticizing former President Donald Trump after the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. She was removed from her position as the third-ranking Republican within the House of Representatives after voting to impeach the former president for his alleged involvement in the insurrection. Cheney also served as one of only two Republicans on the House select committee that investigated the riot, with former Representative Adam Kinzinger being the panel's second GOP member.  On Sunday, some students at the private liberal arts college seemed eager to express their distaste for Cheney by booing her. Some of the graduates also turned their chairs away so their backs were facing the former congresswoman as she delivered the commencement address. Although she received a negative response by some, the Daily Mail reported that many students and their parents applauded throughout her remarks.  Newsweek reached out to Cheney's political action committee by email for comment.  Meanwhile on Twitter, photos showed one graduate with an inscribed graduation cap that read: \"Why listen to a racist, imperialist, transphobic, war monger?? Your hate is loud.\" Many social media users believed the student's message was a swipe at Cheney and the Republican Party. However, Trump supporters felt the graduates were booing and turning their backs on Cheney because they were supportive of the former president instead.  \"Liz Cheney gave the commencement address at the Colorado college she graduated from and half the graduates turned their chairs to show her their backs!\" Twitter user @Daytobehappy tweeted, who claims to be \"ultra MAGA\" in her Twitter bio.  Other people within the MAGA community also felt the negative reaction was because of Trump supporters in the crowd. Most MAGA members denounced Cheney after Trump called her a \"bitter, horrible human being\" when she was purged from the House of Representatives in 2021.  \"She has no personality or anything good having to do with politics or our Country. She is a talking point for Democrats, whether that means the Border, the gas lines, inflation, or destroying our economy. She is a warmonger whose family stupidly pushed us into the never-ending Middle East Disaster, draining our wealth and depleting our Great Military, the worst decision in our Country's history...,\" Trump said in a statement in May 2021.  According to the Daily Mail, Cheney spoke poorly of Trump and the Republican Party during her speech to the graduates, specifically regarding the 2020 election and the insurrection, but didn't expound on Trump's 2024 presidential bid. She also avoided addressing her own future in politics, which has been a question ever since she was ousted by Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman last year.  \"Returning from sister's Colorado College graduation where most seniors turned their backs in protest on commencement speaker Liz Cheney. MAGA sentiment now reaches deep into liberal arts campuses,\" Twitter user @jawillick tweeted on Sunday.  However, some people respected Cheney for turning her back on the Republican Party.  \"Liz Cheney calls out Trump & DeSantis. 'Any candidate who says he will pardon Jan 6th defendants isn't qualified to be president.' And during speech at Colorado College, Cheney said Republicans wanted her to lie, say 2020 election was stolen. But Cheney put country over party!\" Twitter user @AlexButterfly01 tweeted.  For months, people have questioned if Cheney will throw her hat into the ring for the 2024 presidential election in an effort to block Trump in his path to reelection, but the former congresswoman has yet to officially announce any future political plans.  Meanwhile, Trump remains the GOP frontrunner in polling for the 2024 election. A recent Harvard/Harris poll conducted from May 17 to 18 shows Trump has a 42-point lead over his closest contender, which is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

        "text": "© Anna Moneymaker/Getty Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) speaks at a press conference on the introduction of the Senate ETHICS Act outside of the U.S. Capitol Building on April 18, 2023 in Washington, DC.  Senator John Fetterman's recent appearance at a Senate hearing caught the attention of admirers and detractors alike, with some observers applauding the Democrat for his line of questioning and others speculating if he's fit to serve Congress.  On Tuesday, the Senate's banking committee held the hearing to examine what led to Silicon Valley Bank's collapse in March. At one point, Fetterman questioned former SVB CEO Greg Becker. The Democratic senator, who recently returned to the Senate after being away for more than a month to receive inpatient care for clinical depression, stuttered as he asked Becker if there should be work requirements for bank executives whose financial institutions have to be bailed out.  \"Republicans want a work requirement for SNAP, for hungry families.... Shouldn't you have a working requirement after we [bail out] your bank?\" Fetterman asked at the end of the hearing. When Becker did not respond after a few moments, Fetterman turned the hearing back over to the committee's chairman, Senator Sherrod Brown.  Reacting on Twitter, conservative podcaster Graham Allen said that Fetterman is \"still struggling and hasn't recovered from his stroke,\" which he suffered during his 2022 Senate campaign in Pennsylvania, and accused the Democratic Party of \"using\" the senator and not caring for his well-being.  Internet personality Collin Rugg tweeted that it was \"the most painful 90 seconds you will watch all month,\" while conservative commentator and OutKick founder Clay Travis said Fetterman was \"incapable of speech or coherent thought.\"  Joe Calvello, a spokesman for Fetterman, told Newsweek that his team has clearly said for months that the former lieutenant governor \"continues to have auditory processing issues due to the effects of his stroke.\"  \"If sickos on the internet want to keep making fun of John for recovering from a health challenge, that's between them and their consciences,\" Calvello said.  But the feedback that Fetterman received was not all negative.  \"I'm so glad John Fetterman is back in the Senate,\" tweeted Victor Shi, the youngest Illinois delegate for Joe Biden at the 2020 Democratic Convention. \"He just grilled the current CEO of Silicon Valley Bank about whether CEOs who crash banks should be subjected to work requirements. That CEO literally couldn't say a single word in response.\"  Fetterman's chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, said he was stunned and impressed by the senator's comments, adding that he \"almost fell out of my chair\" hearing his questions for Becker.  \"I am not ashamed to admit I was wrong about Fetterman. He's not only speaking up, he's been sponsoring and cosponsoring legislation and generally being an active and solid member of the party,\" Democrat @StabbyandSpicy tweeted in response to the clip of the senator on Tuesday. \"Good on him.\"  Related Articles  Start your unlimited Newsweek trial<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nSen.

        "text": "© Provided by 1945 AOC  AOC In Trouble? - Earlier this year, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was the subject of an ethics complaint filed by the Heritage Foundation for \"falsely accusing\" and \"defaming' a social media content creator. The complaint argued that the firebrand lawmaker had violated House ethics rules by \"knowingly and intentionally defaming Chaya Raichik, creator of the viral Libs of TikTok account, falsely accusing her of lying and disseminating disinformation.\"  Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip Ad  At issue was that Ocasio-Cortez claimed Raichik was lying during a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing last month.  \"Are you aware… that from August 11th to August 16th that account posted false information about Boston Children's Hospital claiming that they were providing hysterectomies to children?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked. \"And are you aware that this lie was then circulated by other prominent far-right influences?\"  AOC: Ethics Complaint?  The nine-page complaint by The Heritage Foundation essentially defended Raichik's view that Boston Children's Hospital was actually performing gender-affirming hysterectomies on young girls.  \"Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's accusation that the tweet contained false information is itself outrightly false on its face. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez knowingly made this allegation in bad faith,\" the Heritage complaint noted, adding that Ocasio-Cortez \"recklessly blamed Ms. Raichik and her tweet for the actions of other people reacting to Boston Children's Hospital's video, claiming that it fueled threats and harassment towards the hospital and its staff and incited violence against 'trans and LGBT people.'\"  The Heritage Foundation has called for the Office of Congressional Ethics to reprimand Ocasio-Cortez, while the complaint was also meant to remind other lawmakers that false accusations should not be tolerated. The foundation further called upon Ocasio-Cortez to apologize to Raichik.  The complaint came just a month after a House Ethics Committee disclosed in early March that it had extended its review of Ocasio-Cortez's appearance at the 2021 Met Gala following an allegation that she may have accepted impermissible gifts associated with the event.  Past Legal Woes  This is hardly the first time Ocasio-Cortez has been in the spotlight for her use of social media. In 2019, she was forced to apologize for blocking the Twitter account of a former Brooklyn assemblyman. That apology came after a federal appeals court made a landmark ruling that then-President Donald Trump violated the Constitution by blocking critics on the social media platform.  The ruling set a precedent that any elected official – from a local mayor to the president of the United States – may not block a constituent on Twitter as it would violate the constituent's First Amendment rights to express his/her views.  In March, Ocasio-Cortez was again sued – that time by comedian Alex Stein – after she blocked his Twitter account last year. Stein has a history of confronting politicians.  Strange Bedfellows Indeed  Even as Ocasio-Cortez's ethics and potential legal battles continue, on Tuesday, she received support from an unlikely ally, Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz.  Last week, Ocasio-Cortez and Gaetz were two of the sponsors of the Bipartisan Restoring Faith in Government Act, which would prohibit members of Congress from owning and trading individual stocks.  The fact that the two lawmakers found common ground on anything surprised many, including a pair of hosts on Fox News, who made light of it.  In a Tuesday episode of his \"Firebrand\" podcast, the Florida Republican said he disliked how Fox News hosts — Greg Gutfeld and Jeanine Pirro on \"The Five\" — humorously speculated that Gaetz would end his marriage with his wife, Ginger Luckey, and marry Ocasio-Cortez instead, Insider reported.  \"I have got a bone to pick with The Five,\" Gaetz said in his podcast, speaking with fellow Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona.  \"And it does seem a little childish to me that the media always has to over-sexualize everything that AOC is involved with,\" Gaetz noted. \"They wouldn't do that to men, and two people can engage in serious legislation that's not renaming some post office. We're trying to make our Congress more honest and more ethical — without that type of, I think, very childish and immature commentary.\"  This is also not the first time Gaetz has come to Ocasio-Cortez's defense, even as the two have historically clashed on their political ideologies. Earlier this month, Gaetz told Fox News Channel's Jesse Waters that while he believes the New York Congresswoman is wrong about a lot, she is \"not corrupt.\"  The House Ethics Committee will, of course, make a final decision later this year.

        "text": "© Provided by Washington Examiner  If you want to know which states support thriving black communities, you can find the answer in two ways.  You might look at data and see which states have growing black communities and which do not. You might instead listen to such fallen organizations as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  ENTER DESANTIS  The NAACP's board of directors this week issued a “formal travel advisory” against Florida. It was entirely political, mentioning Gov. Ron DeSantis by name just as he was announcing his campaign for the presidency.  “Florida is openly hostile toward African Americans,” the NAACP notice claims, citing DeSantis’s “aggressive attempts to erase Black history and to restrict diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in Florida schools.\"  On the second charge, restricting DEI programs in Florida schools, DeSantis would probably agree. DEI programs are proven failures that only increase racial division. Every governor should be eliminating their use across state government.  On the first charge, that DeSantis has attempted to “erase Black history,” the NAACP is factually wrong. Florida schools are required by law to teach “the history of African peoples,” including “the passage to America” and “the enslavement experience.” These lessons include “how the freedoms of persons have been infringed by sexism, slavery, racial oppression, racial segregation, and racial discrimination.”  So much for marginalizing “the contributions of and challenges faced by African Americans,” as the advisory claims.  If the NAACP wants to identify states where policy is hostile to blacks, it should turn its eyes to states and cities run by Democrats. At the end of 2022, the national black unemployment rate stood at 6.1%. In Florida, it was more than two points lower at 3.8%. Meanwhile, black unemployment was higher than the national average in California (7.5%), Illinois (10.9%), and New York (8.3%).  The story is worse in Democratically run cities. In New York City, for example, 12.2% of blacks are unemployed. Compare that to Miami, where the black unemployment rate is 4.7%. If you are a black person looking for a job, California, Illinois, and New York are far more hostile environments than Florida.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER  Black people know this even if organizations such as the NAACP, which claim to speak for them, do not. That is why black families, especially middle-class black families, are leaving Democratically run states in droves. New York City has lost 9% of its black population over the past 20 years. Over the past 40 years, the black populations of Compton, San Francisco, and Oakland have fallen by 45%, 43%, and 40%, respectively. Black families are fleeing Chicago too. Meanwhile, Florida’s black population has grown from 3.1 million in 2010 to 3.8 million today.  The NAACP claims to be an organization “committed to a world without racism where black people enjoy equitable opportunities in thriving communities.” It may want to spend less time worrying about thriving, happily employed black communities in Florida and more time figuring out which Democratic policies are destroying black communities in blue states.

Either way, whenever Newsom decided to throw his hat into the ring for a Democrat presidential nomination, he would use the reparations task force to campaign hard for the Black vote, which is particularly influential in Democratic presidential primaries, as Joe Biden can attest.  CALIFORNIA REPARATIONS PANEL WANTS TO GIVE STATE AGENCY VETO POWER OVER LOCAL REAL ESTATE DECISIONS  But now, it appears there was a third possibility that Newsom had not foreseen. The reparations task force started making proposals that featured mind-bogglingly large numbers – most recently, the task force proposed cash reparations of up to $1.2 million per person.  © Jane Tyska/Digital First Media/East Bay Times via Getty Images California's ridiculous reparations proposal complicates Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's political future and the prospect of a presidential campaign. California's ridiculous reparations proposal complicates Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's political future and the prospect of a presidential campaign. Jane Tyska/Digital First Media/East Bay Times via Getty Images  The total price tag for the plan is estimated at about $800 billion, which is on par with what the entire country spends on national defense. California is already facing a $22.5 billion budget deficit, with little leeway to raise taxes on a populace that is already fleeing in droves to low-tax states such as Texas and Florida. Even under the best of circumstances $800 billion is orders of magnitude more than the state could possibly afford.  READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP  Newsom was stuck. He couldn’t let people think he was actually backing such an outrageous scheme, because it would have destroyed whatever credibility he has left as a serious leader. But at the same time, the reparations task force is his baby, so he can’t exactly be honest. He had to make noncommittal noises and suggest that perhaps the task force could come up with another idea that wasn’t quite so … flamboyant.  Then the task force let him down again, this time with a proposal to give the state the power to micromanage municipal real estate ordinances. In a nutshell, the state would be able to wield veto power over local zoning ordinances based on what bureaucrats believe would best promote diversity.  It’s a colossally bad idea that would create far more problems than it solves. Instead of letting local citizens and their elected officials make decisions that will directly impact their lives, it gives power over to unelected bureaucrats in Sacramento who would make those decisions based not on what might be best for the local residents, but on what they believe is necessary to correct historical injustices that are neither well-defined nor inherently quantifiable.  How do you put a price on your grandfather having to live in a less-desirable area because of redlining? How, 40 or 50 years after the fact, can you quantify the economic impact of someone going to prison for a crime that they might not have been charged with had their skin been a different color? Newsom’s task force tried to do just that, and they came up with a figure that nobody in their right mind could take seriously.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  But even if it were possible to come up with the money, would reparations actually be a force for good? Can a one-time infusion of cash or artificial advantages in access to higher education or housing actually vault families one or more rungs up the economic ladder?  The truth is reparations are built on a fallacy – the mistaken belief that a household’s economic standing is based solely on questions of finances. There’s so much more to it than mere money, and simply splashing some cash around can’t magically solve all the problems that arose over the course of generations.  Yes, slavery was bad. Yes, systemic racism has held back generations of Black Americans from achieving their full potential. Yes, we should be looking for ways to offer economic empowerment to the Black community. But no, reparations are not the answer.  © Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Kamilah Moore, chair of the California Reparations Task Force, left, and Amos Brown, vice chair, at the California Science Center in Los Angeles on Sept. 22, 2022.

You can’t rectify that injustice by giving their descendants money, which is all too easily squandered. What’s really needed is opportunity – to break the cycle of poverty, to accumulate savings and build wealth, and in general to do all of the things that bring people closer to achieving their American Dream.  Gavin Newsom’s political experiment with reparations has blown up in his face. But that might turn out to be the best outcome for Black Americans, because it will force us all to take a step back and reassess what’s really needed to right the wrongs of our history and build a society that is just and equitable for all Americans.

        "text": "© SkyFi A satellite image of the huge clothing dump in the Atacama Desert, provided by SkyFi. The discarded clothes are located near the municipality of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.  A satellite image has revealed an enormous pile of discarded clothing that is so big it's visible from space.  The clothing pile, which contains everything from Christmas sweaters to ski boots, is located in the Atacama Desert—the driest non-polar desert in the world—near the municipality of Alto Hospicio in northern Chile.  The pile is spread out across a clearing in the desert terrain. One side of the pile measures more than 1,000 feet across.  Texas-based satellite imagery company SkyFi recently shared an image of the pile, revealing the true scale of the pollution problem created by the fashion industry.  Chile has long served as a hub for secondhand and unsold clothing—often manufactured in China or Bangladesh—that is imported into the country from Europe, Asia or the United States before being resold around Latin America, Agence France-Presse reported.  It is estimated that around 59,000 metric tons of clothing arrive at the port of Iquique, which is next to Alto Hospicio, every year. The port is part of the Iquique Free Trade Zone—a duty-free area that was established in an attempt to encourage economic activity.  Some of the clothing arriving at the port are bought up by merchants in the Chilean capital of Santiago, while large quantities are smuggled out of the country to other parts of Latin America. But at least 39,000 metric tons that cannot be sold end up at clandestine dumps in the desert, such as the one near Alto Hospicio.  SkyFi first found out about the huge clothing pile from an article in 2021 and was curious to verify whether it was true.  \"There is a lot of misinformation out there, and we often use satellite imagery as a primary data point, a source of verification,\" SkyFi Growth Marketing Manager Tom Babb told Newsweek. \"In the Earth observation community, this is referred to as 'ground truth.'\"  SkyFi says its aim is to make access to Earth observation data easier. The company has created a platform that serves as a marketplace for EO data.  SkyFi partners with satellite imaging, aerial imaging and drone providers that already have their own technology in space. The company then resells data from these partners on its platform, enabling people to purchase high-quality satellite imagery through a website and mobile app.  \"Before us, there were few ways to actually access the imagery, as most of the satellite companies only work with governments or large corporations,\" Babb said.  After finding out about the clothing pile, SkyFi staff went on Google Earth to find it. The company often uses Google Earth as a first step before purchasing an image from one of its partners on the SkyFi platform.  But when the staffers looked, they could not find the pile or locate its coordinates. So SkyFi reached out to its Discord community, where some individuals were able to help SkyFi locate the pile.  Afterward, the company looked on its platform to see if any partners had existing images of the pile and found some.  The image shown above, which has a \"very high\" spatial resolution of 50 centimeters, is one of those images. It was taken on January 7, 2022. Several more images on the SkyFi platform are more recent, but this one has the highest resolution.  \"We were able to verify that there is indeed a pile of clothes in the middle of the desert in Chile,\" Babb said.

        "text": "© Provided by 2Paragraphs Governor Ron DeSantis  Former President Donald Trump set his four-letter word trap for rival Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last week when he disemboweled DeSantis’s campaign keynote, painting the term “woke” as a loser politically.  That’s a problem, Trump knows, for DeSantis, who is running his rival presidential campaign on just two main ideas so far — the wonderfulness of Florida and the horror of woke.  The first DeSantis bet is on the presumption that America at large aspires to be more like Florida, which DeSantis portrays as a refuge for “hope and sanity” — especially during the pandemic, when it lifted lockdowns early and let kids back in schools, even if there were fewer books there.   But the far more prominent message of DeSantis’s campaign is that he is Anti-Woke — and not just that, but that he is The Great Woke Hunter, like some figure out of Hemingway with a rifle and a sense of manliness that necessitates a corruption of compassion.  In Iowa this week, even after Trump laid his trap, DeSantis doubled down on his Anti-Woke Hero pose, as seen below.  Trump set the trap earlier this week when he said woke doesn’t mean anything, or that “half the people” don’t know what it means. Creating confusion around the concept and thereby creating confusion around DeSantis’s main message is the strategy.  DeSantis already has an innate challenge with campaigning on Anti-Woke, in that it has been hard traditionally to run strictly against something — unless it’s war or new taxes. Otherwise candidates have to be for something — like expanded health care or job creation, things people want.  The DeSantis anti-woke campaign may already have inherent limits nationally too, as polled Americans broadly favor things like diversity and inclusion when done properly. Trying to get people across the country outraged at Chick-fil-A, just because the company pledged to treat people of all backgrounds with dignity, is hard.  Trump sees a vulnerability in DeSantis’s focus, and his plan is to have DeSantis, while aiming at Woke in his Great Woke Hunter outfit, shoot an elephant instead. The establishment GOP elephant, that is.  \"I don't like the term woke, because I hear woke woke woke,\" Trump told a crowd of Magadonians, \"it's just a term they use, you know half the people can't define it, they don't even know what it is.\"  MORE FROM 2PARAGRAPHS<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nThis article discusses how former President Donald Trump set a trap for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by disemboweling his campaign keynote and painting the term \"woke\" as a loser politically.\nDeSantis is running his campaign on the wonderfulness of Florida and the horror of woke.\nTrump sees a vulnerability in DeSantis' focus and is trying to have him shoot an elephant instead.\nPolled Americans broadly favor things like diversity and inclusion, making it difficult for DeSantis to get people across the country outraged at Chick-fil-A.\nTrump believes that half the people don't even know what \"woke\" means.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nFormer President Donald Trump set a trap for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by disemboweling his campaign keynote.\nDeSantis is running his campaign on the wonderfulness of Florida and the horror of 'woke'.\nTrump is trying to create confusion around DeSantis' main message by questioning the meaning of 'woke'.\nPolled Americans broadly favor diversity and inclusion, making it difficult for DeSantis to run an anti-woke campaign."

Bundy is the son of Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who famously was at the heart of an armed conflict with federal agents nearly a decade ago â an event that saw far-right groups like the Oath Keepers coming out to support him.  \"Ammon Bundy and supporters on his property are refusing to accept service of court papers related to a lawsuit filed against him by a state hospital system, St. Lukeâs,\" reported Ben Mathis-Lilley. \"The lawsuit alleges that Bundy and others defamed and harassed the hospital and its employees after a March 2022 incident in which the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare brought the infant grandson of one of Bundyâs friends to a hospital location for medical treatment. Bundy and others then assembled on the grounds of the hospital and refused to leave; he was arrested and pleaded guilty in January of this year to misdemeanor trespassing.\"  \"The hospital has since sued Bundy, the childâs grandfather, and several affiliated activist groups for making false statements about its doctors (that they kidnap and kill children and so forth),\" said the report. \"Bundy has refused to appear in court to respond to the suit, which led the judge in the case to issue a civil arrest warrant against him. Bundyâs Peopleâs Rights Network group has called on supporters to 'surround' and protect him, and on Tuesday, one of them blocked the county sheriffâs office from serving the arrest warrant.\"  IN OTHER NEWS:Marjorie Taylor Greene claims Biden a criminal 'mastermind' after calling him 'mentally incompetent'  Bundy has said he will not show up in court because he considers the lawsuit to be harassment, and furthermore he cannot afford an attorney.  So far, this standoff has been more low-key than the previous one, in which Bundy and his supporters forcibly occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to protest the prosecution of a pair of ranchers who were illegally setting fires, putting them in armed conflict with federal workers.

        "text": "Even in a land known for gargantuan, record-breaking infrastructure, this project is turning heads.  At 15 miles long (24 kilometers), eight lanes wide and featuring artificial islands and an undersea tunnel, China’s $6.7 billion Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge is nothing if not ambitious.  To much fanfare in the country’s state media, the bridge’s builders recently claimed a new world record by paving in a single day more than 243,200 square feet (22,600 square meters) of asphalt, the equivalent of more than 50 basketball courts.  Yet strange as it may sound, this is not the world’s longest sea bridge. That honor belongs to its 34-mile long neighbor, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge – just 20 miles away.  To some observers, the building of these giant bridges in such close proximity is testament both to China’s growing ambitions on the global stage and the problems it faces in realizing them.  Like its sister bridge in Hong Kong, when the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge opens to traffic next year after eight years of construction, it will form a central plank in China’s master plan to develop its Greater Bay Area, one of the world’s largest and most populated urban areas, into an economic and technological hub that can rival San Francisco, New York or Tokyo.  It’s an ambition that, like the bridges themselves, is simply massive in scale. The Greater Bay Area is home to 68 million people, covers 21,800 square miles and encompasses 11 cities: Hong Kong, Macao and nine others including Zhongshan and Shenzhen. Shenzhen alone is home to more than 12 million people, not to mention scores of multibillion-dollar firms such as drone-maker DJI and social media company Tencent that have helped to earn it the moniker of “China’s Silicon Valley.”  Beijing hopes that the bridges can help bring together the cities in this huge and diverse area both physically and conceptually. Travel times between Zhongshan and the Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport – mainland China’s third busiest, which hosted over 37 million passengers in 2019 – are expected to be cut from two hours (using current roads) to 20 minutes.  But many observers believe the bridges are also meant to serve another, more political purpose, by subsuming what are at present quite disparate regions – Hong Kong is a former British colony, Macao a former Portuguese one – into a single Chinese identity. And, according to some critics, the scale of this undertaking dwarfs even that of the bridges.  Making a statement  Austin Strange, who specializes in Chinese foreign policy at the University of Hong Kong, said the new bridge would no doubt bring “real economic value” by drastically reducing commute times between the cities while also cutting traffic.  But he said there was a secondary dimension, too, likening it to China’s efforts with its Belt and Road Initiative, in which Beijing is spending billions on funding infrastructure projects like ports and roads in countries across the world.  That project is widely seen as an effort by China to boost its economic and political clout on the world stage, with some critics accusing it of gaining leverage over smaller countries by extending loans they cannot hope to repay.  While no such debt concerns exist with the bridges, which are being built on Chinese territory, observers say the scale of the project sends a message nonetheless.  “China’s government is clearly advertising the bridge as a world-class accomplishment,” Strange said. “Infrastructure is a core part of China’s reputation in global development, and is also a key link between how China approaches domestic and international development.”  Still, how profound an impression the bridge will make on the rest of the world will depend in part not only on its size, but how successful and popular with travelers it ultimately proves.  Otherwise, it risks opening itself to a criticism often leveled at some of the more grandiose Belt and Road projects – that is an expensive white elephant.  © Provided by CNN The Shenzhen-Zhongshan bridge project features artificial islands and an undersea tunnel. - Deng Hua/Xinhua/Getty Images  Finance professor He Zhiguo from University of Chicago said that, just like the bridges that link up the coasts of the San Francisco Bay, the Chinese mega project was likely to slash travel times.  However, he said only local citizens in Zhongshan were likely to emerge as winners, with the laid-back city, known neither as a business hub nor tourist hotspot, providing few incentives for others to visit.  He also said estimates about the effect on travel times and costs should be taken with a pinch of salt as projects could easily get bloated. “That’s my worry. But without knowing more, I think it’s not a bad idea,” he said.  Bridges over troubled water  Ambitious though Beijing’s vision of the Greater Bay Area is, there have already been plenty of bumps in the road.  The idea was first raised in 2009, but experts say development has been hampered because of the disparate nature of, and barriers between, some of the cities involved.  The region incorporates three borders – with the Chinese mainland and the former colonies of Hong Kong and Macao, which are now semi-autonomous Special Administrative Regions of China, each maintaining separate immigration systems, separate legal systems and even separate currencies.  Additionally, residents carry three different passports and identity cards, and speak two different forms of Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin).  They even drive on different sides of the road, all of which means there are plenty of obstacles to those hoping for a carefree road trip between them.  Critics say some of these problems were in evidence when the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge’s sister project, the $20 billion Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao Bridge, opened in 2018.  That bridge connects the mainland Chinese city of Zhuhai with gambling hub Macao and leading financial center Hong Kong.  Even by 2019, a year after its launch, it was still struggling to draw in traffic, logging just 4,000 trips per day, according to Hong Kong’s Transport Department. (By comparison, the Channel Tunnel in Europe, which connects France and Britain, drew more than 8,000 vehicles on average per day in March this year, according to its website.)  Experts put the lukewarm response down to the need for travelers to obtain different visas and vehicle registrations to travel between the three places – especially because high-speed ferries already crisscross the three cities on a daily basis, leaving from central terminals that are often more accessible than the border areas where the bridges begin.  Traffic on the Hong Kong bridge plunged to just hundreds of vehicles a day during the Covid pandemic, as each of the three regions sealed off their borders as part of a strict “zero-Covid” policy, though usage has since increased. During the Labor Day holiday period this month state media reported up to 9,000 vehicles crossing daily.  Meanwhile, the controversy over the bridges goes beyond purely financial matters.  Some see the bridges as a political act. Opponents have criticized the Hong Kong bridge as a means by which to force assimilation and exert control on the city, which was rocked by pro-democracy protests in 2014 and in 2019.  © Provided by CNN An aerial view of the world's longest cross-sea bridge, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, in Zhuhai city, south China's Guangdong province, 19 March 2019. - Liang jie/ICHPL Imaginechina/AP  Don’t worry, ‘there will be traffic jams’  Still, the bridges have their fans, too.  Xiao Geng, director of Institute of Policy and Practice at the Shenzhen campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge would help to level up the two areas.  “The west side of the coast is not as developed as the east side of the coast, and there is also a huge discrepancy in property prices between the two sides,” Xiao said.  He also said the bridge was different to its predecessor, which had been beset by the “fundamentally different” systems of the three places, which had put people off by raising the cost of travel.  The latest bridge would connect two mainland Chinese cities that were already under the same regulations, he pointed out.  “You don’t have to worry. There will be traffic jams,” he said.

        "text": "© (Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader) Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks to a group of the Basij paramilitary force in Tehran in November. ( Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks to a group of the Basij paramilitary force in Tehran in November. ( (Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader)  Iran hanged two men Monday convicted of blasphemy, authorities said, carrying out rare death sentences for the crime as executions surge across the Islamic Republic following months of unrest.  Iran remains one of the world's top executioners, having put to death at least 203 prisoners since the start of this year alone, according to the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights. But carrying out executions for blasphemy remains rare, as previous cases saw the sentences reduced by authorities.  The two men executed, Yousef Mehrad and Sadrollah Fazeli Zare, died at Arak Prison in central Iran. They had been arrested in May 2020, accused of being involved in a channel on the Telegram message app called “Critique of Superstition and Religion,” according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. Both men faced months of solitary confinement and could not contact their families, the commission said.  The Mizan news agency of Iran's judiciary confirmed the executions, describing the two men as having insulted the prophet Muhammad and promoted atheism. Mizan also accused them of burning a Quran, Islam's holy book, though it wasn't clear whether the men allegedly did that or such imagery was shared in the Telegram channel.  Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, who leads Iran Human Rights, decried the executions as exposing the “medieval nature” of Iran's theocracy.  “The international community must show with its reaction that executions for expressing an opinion is intolerable,” he said in a statement. “The refusal of the international community to react decisively is a green light for the Iranian government and all their like-minded people around the world.”  It wasn't immediately clear when Iran carried out its last execution for blasphemy. Other countries in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia, also allow for death sentences to be imposed for blasphemy.  The streak of executions, including members of ethnic minority groups in Iran, comes as months-long protests over the September death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after her arrest by the country's morality police have cooled. Already, at least four people charged over alleged crimes from the demonstrations have been put to death.  The protests, which reportedly saw more than 500 people killed and 19,000 others arrested, marked one of the biggest challenges to Iran’s theocracy since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  In 2022, Iran executed at least 582 people, up from 333 people in 2021, according to Iran Human Rights. Amnesty International's most recent report on executions put Iran as the world's second-largest executioner, behind only China, where thousands are believed to be put to death a year.

        "text": "WASHINGTON — The founder of the far-right Oath Keepers has been sentenced to 18 years in federal prison in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol following his conviction on seditious conspiracy.  The sentence for Stewart Rhodes is the longest imposed on a Jan. 6 defendant to date. In a politically-charged speech in the courtroom just before his sentencing, he called himself a \"political prisoner\" and said that when he talked about \"regime change\" in a phone call with supporters earlier this week, he meant he hopes that former President Donald Trump will win in 2024.  The judge disagreed that Rhodes had been locked up for politics, saying it was his actions that led to his criminal convictions.  “You, sir, present an ongoing threat and a peril to this country and to the republic and to the very fabric of this democracy,\" Judge Amit Mehta said before handing down the sentence.  Rhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy in November along with Kelly Meggs, a fellow Oath Keepers member.  \"They won't fear us until we come with rifles in hand,\" Rhodes wrote in a message ahead of the Jan. 6 attack. After the attack, in a recording that was played in court during his trial, he said his only regret was that they “should have brought rifles.”  Wearing an orange prison jumpsuit Thursday, Rhodes said he believes the only crime he committed was opposing those who are “destroying our country.”  Mehta told Rhodes that he was found guilty of seditious conspiracy “not because of your beliefs, not because you supported the other guy, not because Joe Biden is president right now,” but because of the facts of the case, and his actions before, during and after Jan. 6.  “You are not a political prisoner, Mr. Rhodes,” he said.  Meggs was also sentenced by Judge Mehta Thursday, to 12 years in federal prison. Mehta said Meggs did not pose the same continuing threat as Rhodes and a shorter sentence was more appropriate. The 12-year sentence for Meggs is the third longest handed down for a Jan. 6 defendant.  An emotional Meggs delivered a statement and apologized to his family for the pain and suffering he’d caused them. Meggs’ sister, brother and son were in the courtroom — his wife Connie, who also participated in the Jan. 6 riot and has been separately convicted on multiple counts, was not present.  “I want to apologize to those that I’ve disappointed and let down,” Meggs said. “My deepest regret is the pain and suffering I’ve caused my family.”  Rhodes and Meggs were put on trial alongside Jessica Watkins, Kenneth Harrelson and Thomas Caldwell, fellow Oath Keepers who were convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding and aiding and abetting, but not seditious conspiracy. Watkins and Harrelson will be sentenced Friday.  Rhodes took the stand in his case, saying at the trial that the other members of the Oath Keepers were \"stupid\" to storm the Capitol and that he disagreed with those who went inside; Rhodes did not enter the building. “I had no idea that any Oath Keeper was even thinking about going inside or would go inside,” he said.  But the government also produced messages in which Rhodes said he thought that Jan. 6 was the last opportunity to stop what he saw as a takeover of the government.  \"On the 6th, they are going to put the final nail in the coffin of this Republic, unless we fight our way out. With Trump (preferably) or without him, we have no choice,\" Rhodes wrote in a message ahead of Jan. 6.  © Provided by NBC News Stewart Rhodes at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. (Ford Fischer / News2Share)  He also celebrated Oath Keepers' actions in the immediate aftermath of the attack, after meeting with other members of the group at an Olive Garden restaurant in Virginia that night.  “Patriots, it was a long day but a day when patriots began to stand,\" he wrote the night of Jan. 6. \"Stand now or kneel forever. Honor your oaths. Remember your legacy.\"  Prior to Thursday's sentence, Peter Schwartz, who was armed with a wooden tire knocker and engaged in a series of assaults on officers during the Capitol attack, had received the longest time behind bars for a Jan. 6 defendant: just more than 14 years.

        "text": "© Provided by The Daily Beast Colombian Air Force via Reuters  In the early hours of May 1, a light aircraft flying over the Amazon rainforest in Colombia issued a mayday alert over an engine failure before vanishing from radar systems.  Rescue teams later found the wreckage of the Cessna 206 and three adult bodies inside—including that of Ranoque Mucutuy. But Mucutuy’s four children, which included an 11-month-old baby—were missing. On Wednesday, Colombian President Gustavo Petro shared some wonderful news.  “After arduous searching by our military, we have found alive the four children who went missing after a plane crash in Guaviare,” Petro tweeted, referring to the Colombian province where the aircraft went down. “A joy for the country.”  But local media reports soon contradicted the celebratory news. Defense sources told Colombia’s El Espectador newspaper that the three kids—aged 13, 11, and 4—and the baby had not been confirmed found.  On Thursday, the country’s Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) issued a statement about the confusion, saying that it had received information from a contact that the children had “appeared alive and in good health,” according to El Espectador, but that soldiers involved in the search “have not been able to have contact with the children” due to weather conditions and difficulties operating in the search area.  An official confirmation as to the children’s wellbeing has not yet been made as of Thursday morning. But rescue efforts were stepped up on Wednesday after a search party discovered a shelter built with sticks and branches which indicated there could have been survivors.  Authorities also published photographs online showing a hair band and a pair of scissors that were found during the search, while a baby bottle and some partially-eaten fruit were also discovered.  The family are from the Indigenous Huitoto people who live in Colombia’s south-east and the north of Peru. A message was reportedly played over the remote rainforest search area in the Huitoto language from a helicopter, in which the children’s grandmother instructed the kids to not attempt to move through the rainforest.  Over 100 soldiers have taken part in the rescue mission along with sniffer dogs. Military aircraft have also been deployed to assist the search teams on the ground moving through the dense jungle.  The crashed Cessna was carrying seven passengers on a flight between Araracuara, in Amazonas province, and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province. Along with the children’s mother, the body of the pilot and another adult were found in the doomed aircraft. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nFour children, including an 11-month-old baby, went missing after a plane crash in Colombia. \nColombian President Gustavo Petro shared news that the children had been found alive and in good health. \nOver 100 soldiers and military aircraft have been deployed to assist in the rescue mission. \nThe crashed Cessna was carrying seven passengers on a flight between two cities in Colombia.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nThe Colombian President Gustavo Petro announced on Wednesday that the four children who went missing after a plane crash in Guaviare had been found alive.\nHowever, local media reports contradicted the news and the Institute of Family Welfare said they had received information that the children had been found alive but had not been able to contact them.\nOver 100 soldiers, sniffer dogs, and military aircraft have been deployed to assist the search teams on the ground.\nThe crashed Cessna was carrying seven passengers and the bodies of the pilot and another adult were found in the wreckage."

        "text": "Â© Janos Kummer/Getty Images Tucker Carlson speaks during the Mathias Corvinus Collegium Feszt in Hungary in August 2021. (Janos Kummer/Getty Images)  Lesser-known cable channels are itching to build a new brand around him. Industry experts think he could make a mint in podcasting.  But Tucker Carlson â who was fired by Fox News last week at the height of his popularity and influence in right-wing punditry â has aspirations of moving into a larger role that doesnât limit him to a single medium, according to people familiar with his thinking. And he is willing to walk away from some of the millions that Fox is contractually obligated to pay him, if that would give him the flexibility to have a prominent voice in the 2024 election cycle.  Most ambitiously, Carlson wants to moderate his own GOP candidate forum, outside of the usual strictures of the Republican National Committee debate system. The idea, which he has discussed with Donald Trump, the front-runner for the party nomination, would test his vaunted sway over conservative politics. And it would take a jab at his former employer â Fox is hosting the first official primary debate, which Trump has threatened not to attend â if he can manage to make his grandest plan happen.  Ultimately, Carlson is scrambling to try to avoid the fate of other once-towering former Fox News personalities, who in exile from the network have found lucrative gigs but nothing like their former positions of influence.  âIf Iâm sitting in his seat right now, Iâm plotting really my own media company, how I want to build it,â said Joel Cheatwood, a former Fox News and CNN executive who helped found theblaze.com with Glenn Beck after his forced departure from Fox News in 2011. âWhether you like him or not, there are very few individual brands out there that you can almost guarantee an incredibly significant following from day one.â  Carlsonâs Fox contract reportedly runs through the end of 2024, which would limit his options, though a source close to Carlson said he might accept less money than he is owed to be able to get back into the media game before then. Hollywood lawyer Bryan Freedman, who is representing Carlson, did not respond to a message asking about his contractual status.  Among the smaller broadcasters that have approached Carlson are the faith-based Trinity Broadcasting Network and the far-right One America News Network. OANâs founder and chief executive, Robert Herring Sr., fulsomely praised Carlson as having âthe largest and most passionate audience in cable news,â adding that the company has âmade our interest clear.â  A stronger pitch has come from Newsmax, the conservative media company that has seen a prime-time ratings surge this past week at the same time Fox was losing viewers from Carlsonâs old time slot.  Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy approached Carlson and his associates with a wide-ranging proposal that, in the words of one person familiar with the pitch, would involve ârebranding Newsmax under Tuckerâs name.â Carlson and his advisers are intrigued by the idea of his own media company, and taking over an existing one would be easier than building from the ground up â though any possible deal would boil down to unresolved questions of money and editorial control.  And Cheatwood speculated that Carlson would diminish his own brand by signing on with a smaller media company. âI just donât think he needs it,â he added. âHeâs just so much bigger than they are.â  Many in conservative corners of the digital media world have assumed that Carlson â a polarizing personality whose disparaging comments about immigrants, defense of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists and dabbling in paranoid white-nationalist theories during his years on Fox would make him toxic for mainstream media companies â will strike out with his own podcast or streaming show.  âHe could do very well and find an audience immediately, and he could earn a good living and never have to leave his home studio,â said Ken LaCorte, a former digital-side executive for Fox News.  In 2020, Carlsonâs team explored the idea of launching a podcast as a âjoint venture of sortsâ with his then-employers at Fox, according to a text message exchange made public in a recent defamation lawsuit against the network. And since his firing, his team has fielded inquiries from potential podcast partners.  But Carlson doesnât want to just be a podcaster, people in his circle say. He wants to produce documentaries and host live events as well.  Twitter has also emerged as an area of intrigue for Carlson. Thatâs where he went to issue his first public comments after his dismissal, and his team was impressed by the number of views amassed by the video, according to people familiar with their thinking.  Carlson has not had any recent conversations with Twitter or its political-provocateur new owner, Elon Musk; but shortly before he left Fox, he had a briefing from Twitter tech staff about new features for subscriptions and other ways for content creators to make money from the platform.  Beck praised the Twitter video, in which Carlson claimed that television news shuts off legitimate debate. âYou see what heâs setting up here? Heâs setting up a different kind of show, a show where he takes big issues and he debates them,â Beck said last week on his own show. âThatâs where heâs headed.â (Beck, who pivoted to digital video after being forced out of Fox, has already offered Carlson a job.)  Carlson and his team have discussed the possibility of moderating a candidate forum outside of the traditional protocols surrounding the GOP primary debate system, according to two people familiar with the considerations. These people said the setup â as well as Carlsonâs availability to take on that kind of role, given the noncompete constraints of his contract with Fox â remain unclear. But Carlson has personally expressed enthusiasm about the idea, according to people familiar with his comments. At least one major candidate â Trump â has told Carlson heâs interested, according to a person familiar with the exchange.  The former Fox hostâs interest in a debate is said to stem in part from its potential to loosen the Republican National Committeeâs grip on the process, as well as to challenge the role traditionally played by the major television networks. âHe could go straight to the candidates, stream it live, invite the networks but maintain control over the process,â said one person familiar with the discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships.  Carlson has been approached in recent days by candidates as well as Republican fundraisers about appearing on the campaign trail but is interested in maintaining a more independent posture, according to people with knowledge of his views. A role moderating a debate or delivering analysis about the contest is seen as a way to influence the process without becoming an arm of a particular campaign.  But the main holdup in Carlsonâs post-Fox future is his contract status, which could limit his options until his deal with the network runs out. âFame is a depreciating asset, and Tucker in nine months of relative radio silence would not be nearly as powerful as Tucker is now,â LaCorte said.  âTuckerâs too gifted a writer and host not to put those talents to use every day,â said Vince Coglianese, a friend of Carlson who serves as editorial director for the publication he co-founded, the Daily Caller. âI donât know what format heâll end up in, but Iâm confident heâll be a massive success â which will be good for the country. Anything that breaks the corporate stranglehold on our debates is a huge win.â  While Carlson gave no specifics into his plans in the video he posted on Twitter, he ended it with three words that suggested heâs not planning to recede from the spotlight: âSee you soon.â<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nTucker Carlson was recently fired from Fox News and is looking to move into a larger role in the media. \nHe has discussed the idea of moderating his own GOP candidate forum with Donald Trump. \nSmaller broadcasters such as Trinity Broadcasting Network and One America News Network have approached him, as well as Newsmax. \nHe is also considering launching his own podcast or streaming show, and has discussed the possibility of moderating a debate outside of the traditional protocols.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nTucker Carlson was recently fired from Fox News and is now looking to move into a larger role in the media.\nHe has discussed the idea of moderating his own GOP candidate forum with Donald Trump and has been approached by smaller broadcasters such as Trinity Broadcasting Network and One America News Network.\nHe is also considering launching his own podcast or streaming show, and has discussed the possibility of moderating a candidate forum outside of the traditional protocols.\nHis contract with Fox may limit his options until it runs out."

        "text": "The 24-year-old man suspected of fatally shooting one woman and injuring four others inside a waiting room at a hospital in Atlanta before carjacking a vehicle and fleeing the scene was apprehended Wednesday evening after an hourslong search, police said.  The Atlanta Police Department confirmed the suspect, Deion Patterson, was apprehended in Cobb County. He was booked at Fulton County Jail and faces one charge of murder and four counts of aggravated assault, jail records show.  Police received a call of shots fired on the 11th floor of Northside Hospital's Midtown location just after noon Wednesday, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said in a news conference.  Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning.  Patterson had an appointment at the facility and started shooting in the waiting area, Atlanta Deputy Chief of Investigations Charles Hampton said. He exited the building after only a couple minutes and went on foot to a nearby gas station, where he commandeered a pickup truck that had been left unattended and left the area, Hampton said.  Law enforcement later located the truck. Hampton said after the arrest that the handgun Patterson used was recovered.  The hourslong investigation, which officials said was at times chaotic, included tips from community members and information given by Patterson's family members. Cobb County Police Chief Stuart VanHoozer said license plate-surveilling cameras and other technology was instrumental in the search. Several law enforcement agencies were involved, including Atlanta and Cobb County police, the FBI and U.S. Secret Service were involved in the search, Schierbaum said.  Police had lifted a shelter-in-place advisory for midtown Atlanta earlier Wednesday afternoon but advised community members to avoid the area and remain alert.  \"We've had a successful end to a traumatic day. Today is a day that we can go home and rest easy that the individual that caused harm in our community is under arrest,\" Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said.  Nikita Rapoport, who attends Savannah College of Art and Design, told USA TODAY he lives in the apartment building across from the hospital and was told to stay inside after the shooting.  âI expected Midtown to be safe. Itâs one of the reasons why I chose this building,â he said. âApparently itâs not.â  Woman killed in shooting was a CDC employee  The woman killed in the shooting was identified by the Fulton County medical examinerâs office as Amy St. Pierre.  She was an employee with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spokesperson Benjamin Haynes confirmed to USA TODAY. According to a public LinkedIn profile, St. Pierre worked as a public health adviser for the CDC.  \"CDC is deeply saddened by the unexpected loss of a colleague killed today in the Midtown Atlanta shooting. Our hearts are with her family, friends, and colleagues as they remember her and grieve this tragic loss,\" Haynes said in a statement.  Suspect spotted in Cobb County after shooting  Officials in Cobb County said the suspect was believed to have been in Cobb County about 10 miles away soon after the shooting.  \"We actually went back and did discover that the vehicle had entered Cobb County,\" Cobb County Sgt. Wayne Delk said at a press conference.  Delk said the suspect was seen at about 12:30 p.m. on a surveillance camera but Cobb County police didn't review the footage until about 2:30 p.m. There had been no other sightings of him since then, Delk said, adding that the carjacked vehicle had been recovered by Atlanta Police Department.  One woman, 39, died at the scene, he said. The four injured women â ages 71, 56, 39 and 25 â were taken to a Grady Memorial Hospital, which is close to Northside Hospital's Midtown location, Schierbaum said.  Three of the four injured women were in critical condition from gunshot wounds, and one was stable, said Robert Jansen, chief medical officer at Grady Health System, in an afternoon news conference. The most seriously injured patient was still in the operating room late Wednesday, he said. He declined to share details about the patients' wounds.  It was not immediately clear if the victims were patients or staff, Schierbaum said.  Jansen said the hospital issued a call for a mass casualty event and had multiple surgeons and trauma staff in the trauma bay within minutes, anticipating up to 12 patients. Northside Hospital said it would be closed on Thursday, and all appointments were canceled.  Â© Jeff Amy, AP Emergency vehicles arrive on West Peachtree in Atlanta on Wednesday, May 3, 2023. Police say are investigating an âactive shooter situationâ in a building in Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood and that multiple people had been injured.  Several Atlanta Public Schools locked down after the shooting. By Wednesday afternoon, the district announced it had received the green light from law enforcement to release students from all schools.  \"Out of an abundance of caution, we have dispatched officers at every school for todayâs dismissal,\" the district said in a statement, telling parents and guardians to expect transportation delays.  The shooting suspect entered the U.S. Coast Guard in 2018 and was discharged from active duty in January, according to a statement from the branch, which said it is working closely with law enforcement in the investigation.  \"The Coast Guard is aware of the tragic incident in Atlanta allegedly involving Mr. Deion Patterson. Our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families,\" the Coast Guard said.  Pattersonâs mother, Minyone Patterson, who police said had accompanied her son to the medical office, told The Associated Press by phone that her son had \"some mental instability going on\" from medication he received from the Veterans Affairs health system that he began taking on Friday.  She said her son had wanted Ativan to deal with anxiety and depression but that the VA wouldnât give it to him because they said it would be \"too addicting.\" Sheâs a nurse and said she told them he would only have taken the proper dosage \"because he listened to me in every way.\"  \"Those families, those families,\" she said, starting to sob. \"Theyâre hurting because they wouldnât give my son his damn Ativan. Those families lost their loved ones because he had a mental break because they wouldnât listen to me.\"  She ended the call without saying what medication her son had been taking.  Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock said on the Senate floor Wednesday that his two children's schools were placed on lockdown as police searched for the suspect.  \"They are there. Iâm here, hoping and praying that they are safe. But the truth is none of us is safe,\" Warnock said.  'Frightening trend' Deadly assaults on US medical workers on the rise  Warnock called on lawmakers to act on gun violence and condemned gun lobbyists. He said it was \"deeply upsetting\" that the shooting happened in a medical building where health care workers and first responders work to keep people safe.  âThis happened in a medical facility where people are trying to find healing,â he said.  The incident is the 191st mass shooting in the U.S. this year, defined as at least four victims hit by gunfire, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks shootings.

Authorities in coastal North Carolina are investigating the death of a teenager who became trapped in a hole that was dug in the sand on Saturday May 6, 2023. It is the latest fatality from the scourge of sand holes that continues to claim young people's lives. (Town of Kill Devil Hills via AP)  NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — Authorities in coastal North Carolina are investigating the death of a teenager who became trapped in a hole that was dug in the sand, the latest fatality from the scourge of sand holes that continues to claim young people's lives.  The 17-year-old male died Saturday afternoon in the small resort town of Frisco, which sits along the Cape Hatteras National Seashore on the Outer Banks, the National Park Service said in a statement.  Park rangers responded to a 911 call regarding a teenager trapped in a hole that was dug in a back-dune area behind the beach's primary dune along the Atlantic Ocean, the park service said. The teenager was buried under several feet of sand after an adjacent dune apparently collapsed into the hole.  Rangers and other emergency responders worked with family members to rescue the teen while simultaneously performing CPR, the park service said. Efforts to revive the teen, who lived in Chesapeake, Virginia, failed.  \"We urge visitors not to dig deep holes on the beach due to the danger they present to beachgoers and emergency response staff,” the park service said in a statement on Saturday.  Mike Barber, a park service spokesman, told The Associated Press Monday that the incident remained under investigation and that no new information was available.  Collapsing sand holes have claimed dozens of lives over the decades. The weight of the sand makes it difficult for people to breathe, while the sand can enter people's lungs. The brain and other organs are often deprived of oxygen.  In late March, a 14-year-old boy died after being buried in a sand hole in a rural area of Minnesota. Wabasha County Sheriff Rodney Bartsh said Hunter Flaxbeard’s death has been ruled an accidental suffocation.  In May 2022, a 13-year-old Utah boy died after a sand dune he was digging a tunnel into collapsed and buried him at southern Utah’s Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park.  During that same month, an 18-year-old man died while playing with his sister at a beach in Toms River, New Jersey, when a large hole they were digging in the sand collapsed. His sister was also trapped but was rescued. The family was visiting from Maine.  In 2014, a Fredericksburg, Virginia, man died at Salvo, on North Carolina's Outer Banks, when sand collapsed on top of him after authorities said he was tunneling between two holes.  Those are just some of the examples. In 2007, Dr. Bradley Maron and his father, Dr. Barry Maron, co-authored a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine that cited 31 recreational sand hole deaths since 1985 in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.  They counted another 21 incidents in which a person was rescued from a collapse, in several cases by bystanders who performed CPR.  Bradley Maron told The Associated Press in 2007 that he thought the sand-related deaths were less well-documented than shark attacks.  The Marons’ research found there were 16 sand hole or tunnel deaths in the U.S. from 1990 to 2006 compared with 12 fatal shark attacks for the same period, according to University of Florida statistics.  The father and son based their report largely on news media accounts and internet searches. Most of the incidents were from the last 10 years, when Internet reports were available.  The victims, mostly boys, ranged in age from 3 to 21 years, with the average age being about 12.  Maron and others advise the public not to let young kids play in sand unattended, and not to get in a hole deeper than your knees.  David Elder, ocean rescue director for the town of Kill Devil Hills on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, said he finds large holes that have been dug in the sand multiple times a month.  Sometimes he’ll encounter people on the beach while they’re digging them. Their reactions to his explanations of the dangers range from, “We understand and we’ll take care of it” to “I didn’t even think about that.”  Those conversations about sand holes aren't much different than the ones he has with beachgoers about rip currents and excessive heat conditions.  “It's sadly one of the jobs I have to do,” he said.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nAuthorities in coastal North Carolina are investigating the death of a teenager who became trapped in a sand hole, the latest fatality from the scourge of sand holes that continues to claim young people's lives.\nSand holes have claimed dozens of lives over the decades due to the weight of the sand making it difficult to breathe.\nMike Barber, a park service spokesman, said the incident is still under investigation.\nDavid Elder, ocean rescue director for the town of Kill Devil Hills, advises the public not to let young kids play in sand unattended and not to get in a hole deeper than their knees.<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 2*</b></br>\nA 17-year-old male died in Frisco, North Carolina after becoming trapped in a sand hole.\nSand holes have claimed dozens of lives over the decades due to the weight of the sand and lack of oxygen.\nBeachgoers should not let young kids play in sand unattended and should not get in a hole deeper than their knees.\nOcean rescue director David Elder warns beachgoers about the dangers of sand holes."
