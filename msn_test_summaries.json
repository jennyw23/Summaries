        "text": "© Getty Images GettyImages-1254694766.jpg  So far, Governor Ron DeSantis has yet to actually announce his candidacy for president, despite the fact he all but certainly will jump in the ring. But his decision to wait until the conclusion of Florida’s legislative session and to not directly attack former president Donald Trump has made him uniquely vulnerable to the former president’s barbs.  This weekend, Mr DeSantis caught a break when he and Mr Trump both happened to be in Iowa and the former president’s event got rained out. This gave Mr DeSantis, a politician notorious for his poor retail politics skills, to press the flesh unfettered by the spectre of the former president.  But Mr DeSantis took two kicks to the chin on Tuesday evening. First in Jacksonville, the 12th largest city in America, Mr DeSantis had endorsed the Republican candidate Daniel Davis for mayor.  Jacksonville was the largest city in the United States with a Republican mayor. But Democrat Donna Deegan beat back Mr Davis and will become the city’s first female mayor.  Meanwhile, in Kentucky, Mr DeSantis and Mr Trump engaged in a proxy war in the GOP gubernatorial primary. Mr Trump had endorsed Attorney General Daniel Cameron. This came despite the fact that Mr Cameron is a known protege of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom Mr Trump despises but who keeps an iron grip on the state party. Mr DeSantis, for his part, endorsed Mr Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft in the primary.  Ultimately, Mr Cameron prevailed and Mr Trump could not help but gloat on Truth Social, calling the governor “DeSanctimonious” and saying “The DeSanctimonious backed candidate came in a DISTANT third. Ron’s magic is GONE!” Mr Trump also noted that “DeSanctimonious lost Jacksonville and Kentucky last night. Not good!!!”  Of course, endorsements alone do not determine election results, and multiple factors played into the results in Jacksonville and Kentucky – they are both off-year elections with significantly low turnout. But Mr DeSantis still chose to get involved in both races to flex his political clout, and now he has little to show for it.  Polling has shown that Mr DeSantis has taken a steep tumble ever since his resounding double-digit re-election campaign in November. And when Mr DeSantis has tried to even subtly attack the former president, as he tried doing before Mr Trump’s arrest in relation to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, he has faced the MAGA wrath.  Not only that, but even when Mr DeSantis’ surrogates try to hit back at the former president, it does Mr DeSantis more harm than good. Last week, during Mr Trump’s CNN town hall, Never Back Down, a Super PAC that supports Mr DeSantis, put out a tweet deriding Mr Trump. But Semafor reported that the super PAC now regrets putting out the tweet, with one person calling it a “massive mistake.”  Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis are also now engaged in a war of words on abortion, with Mr Trump hitting Mr DeSantis for signing a six-week abortion ban. He told newly launched outlet The Messenger, “Many people within the pro-life movement feel that that was too harsh,” while Mr DeSantis said “Protecting an unborn child when there’s a detectable heartbeat is something that almost 99% of pro-lifers support.”  All of this comes before Mr DeSantis has even thrown his hat in the race. But he risks being significantly weakened right out of the gate, with his best hope riding on the possibility that Mr Trump will implode.

        "text": "A Tennessee high school teacher was pepper sprayed twice by an unruly student who became incensed after he confiscated her phone during class, new video shows. Dramatic cellphone footage taken during class Friday at Antioch High School captured the rambunctious student confronting her teacher after her phone was taken away as a disciplinary action. The disobedient student had been “texting and Googling answers for her school work,” according to Reddit user @Lazy_Mouse3803, who shared the now-viral clip. In the minute-long video, a female student can be seen getting up from her desk and walking out of the classroom as the student filming repeatedly exclaims, “Nah, mace is crazy!” Students in the classroom laugh and joke before following the rebellious student into the hallway, where she can be seen trying to get back her phone from her teacher. By the time the student filming enters the hallway, the teacher can be heard telling someone in a different classroom: “She just pepper sprayed me.” © Provided by New York Post Cellphone video taken at Antioch High School shows the rambunctious student confronting her teacher who took her phone.Reddit The female student follows him out of the classroom, telling him: “Give me my phone!” She then holds the pepper spray close to his face before spraying him a second time, causing him to fall to his knees and yell.

Two months earlier, the same teacher was punched in the face after taking a different student’s phone when they were caught cheating in class, the post claimed. © Provided by New York Post The student at one point laid out her hand for her teacher to give her back her phone. Reddit Internet users were quick to come to the teacher’s defense and condemn the student’s behavior, with many calling for her expulsion and arrest.

        "text": "New York taxpayers are on the hook to pay government pension benefits for teachers union boss Randi Weingarten — one of the most powerful political operatives in the country — even though she hasn’t stepped into a classroom to teach for a quarter-century.  The culprit is a corrupt, unconstitutional practice that many taxpayers haven’t even heard about. It’s called union release time — and it benefits the government’s favored special interests at the taxpayers’ expense.  Weingarten is the head of the American Federation of Teachers, a private labor union with annual revenue of $200 million a year. The AFT is one of the most politically active special interests in America, giving tens of millions of dollars to political candidates, parties, and political action committees — more than 98% of which is directed to benefit Democrats, some estimates show.  NH LAWMAKER RIPS PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATION: 'LET THE TEACHERS TEACH, AND SHUT UP'  Weingarten claims to have once been a full-time teacher, but that appears to be true only for a tiny portion of her long career, and she hasn’t taught a single student since at least 1997. Since that time, she has worked full-time as a union boss, advocating for the private interests and political causes of the AFT and its affiliates.  © Twitter Randi Weingarten hasn't taught a class in 25 years but she will still get a pension paid by the taxpayers. Randi Weingarten hasn't taught a class in 25 years but she will still get a pension paid by the taxpayers. Twitter  In a recent report, the Freedom Foundation unearthed documents showing that even though Weingarten hasn’t been a public teacher for decades, she is nonetheless going to receive a taxpayer-funded pension because of release time.  READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP  This pernicious practice \"releases\" government employees from the jobs they were originally hired to do, to instead work full-time for private labor unions — all while still receiving their full taxpayer-funded salaries and benefits, including pension benefits.  Release time flouts state constitutional anti-subsidy provisions intended to protect taxpayers against special interest abuse. It may also violate the First Amendment rights of government employees who do not want to support private union activities, as the Goldwater Institute, the free-market think tank where I work, has pointed out in challenging the legality of this practice.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Yet Goldwater Institute research shows that release time exists across the country at all levels of government, costing taxpayers millions of dollars.  Weingarten, for her part, has been on release time for 25 years, meaning she has worked full-time for a private union rather than discharging any public responsibilities. The AFT picks up the tab for her substantial $543,562 in annual compensation, but under an odd provision of the contract between her union and the school district, the district is still on the hook for her government pension benefits.  That means taxpayers in New York are going to pay for Weingarten’s retirement even though she hasn’t performed public service for a quarter-century.  Just like Weingarten, release time employees throughout the country receive government pension benefits for working full-time for private labor unions. That’s wrong: after all, tax dollars should be spent to advance the public interest, not pad the retirement of private, political activists.  The Freedom Foundation has done a valuable service in unearthing this outrageous taxpayer abuse. Now citizens should demand that their tax dollars stop funding special interests and the operatives who are getting rich representing them—and fund the public interest instead.

        "text": "© Natalie Behring/Getty A banner with photos of Tylee Ryan and her brother J.J. Vallow is seen on a fence set up as a memorial near where her body was found on May 10, 2023 in Rexburg, Idaho. Lori Vallow Daybell faces charges of murder, conspiracy and grand theft in connection to the deaths of two of her children — Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow — as well as Tammy Daybell, the previous wife of her husband Chad Daybell.  An Idaho jury found Lori Vallow Daybell guilty on all counts Friday for the murder of her two children and plotting to kill her husband's ex-wife.  The conviction comes after a three-year investigation into the 2019 deaths of Vallow's children, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow. Vallow was indicted alongside her husband, Chad Daybell, in the slayings of the children. Daybell is also facing a first-degree murder charge in the death of his ex-wife, Tammy Daybell, who was found dead in October 2019. Vallow was charged with conspiracy in Tammy Daybell's death.  Vallow was found guilty on two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of conspiracy, as well as grand theft charges for collecting Social Security benefits on behalf of Ryan and JJ Vallow after their deaths. She had pleaded not guilty to all counts.  Idaho Judge Steven Boyce previously granted a request from Vallow's lawyers to take the death penalty off the table, according to The New York Times. The convict now awaits a sentencing date where she will face life in prison.  Ryan and JJ Vallow were first reported missing in November 2019 by JJ's grandparents, Larry and Kay Woodcock. After Friday's verdict, Larry Woodcock addressed reporters outside the Boise, Idaho, courthouse, issuing thanks to the jurors. Woodcock also gave a \"final message\" to Vallow, which was posted to Twitter by News Nation.  \"Turn out the lights. Party's over,\" he said. \"They say that that all good things must end. Lori, it ended.\"  As he concluded his statements, Woodcock also gave a message to the deceased.  \"JJ, I love you. Papa wishes you were here,\" he said. \"Tylee, Papa loves you. Tammy, I never met you. Tammy, you are part of our life. Tammy I am sorry for what happened to you. My heart hurts for these three.\"  Prosecutors said that both Vallow and Daybell had previously been involved in a cult-like, \"doomsday\" belief system, and that Vallow believed her children were \"zombies\" that had been possessed by evil spirits.  Vallow was served an order in January 2020 to prove that her missing children were alive and well, a moment that was caught on video showing both Vallow and Daybell sunbathing in Hawaii while her children were presumably missing. After she failed to prove her children were alive, she was arrested the following month.  In June 2020, investigators found human remains buried on Daybell's property that were later identified as belonging to Ryan and JJ Vallow, reported the Times.  Vallow was also convicted of conspiracy related to the murder of her ex-husband Charles Vallow, who was shot and killed by her now-deceased brother, Alex Cox, in July 2019. Cox claimed he fatally shot Charles Vallow out of self-defense and never faced charges. Cox died in December 2019, reportedly from a blood clot in his lung.  Vallow's trail had been delayed for years after she was initially declared not competent to stand trial and required to receive psychiatric treatment. A trial date has yet to be set for Daybell.  Newsweek has reached out via email to Vallow's attorney, Jim Archibald, for comment on today's verdict.

        "text": "Congress has sent legislation to raise the debt ceiling to President Biden, ending a months-long saga that brought the U.S. days away from a possible default.  The legislation was the product of months of gamesmanship between Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), culminated by furious negotiations and an aggressive effort by leaders in both parties to sell the agreement to their caucuses — which included a number of reluctant lawmakers.  Here are some of the biggest winners and losers from the fight.  WINNERS  Speaker Kevin McCarthy  © Provided by The Hill Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)  There is little question that McCarthy has emerged as the biggest winner of the fight — even if he has also had to take some criticism from his right flank.  McCarthy pushed a major bipartisan deal through Congress and proved wrong his critics who doubted his ability to get a GOP-backed bill raising the debt ceiling through the House.  That early victory gave the Speaker leverage in the subsequent talks, and it was the first big sign that the White House and Democrats had underestimated McCarthy after his rocky election as Speaker.  McCarthy won big Wednesday when 149 members, more than two-thirds of his conference, backed the bill — a show of support for their leader and a bit of a rebuke of the conservatives who had criticized him.  He’ll face challenges going forward, but this was a big political victory in McCarthy’s young Speakership.  Reps. Garret Graves (R-La.) and Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)  © Provided by The Hill Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) hugs Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)  Graves and McHenry, the Republicans appointed by McCarthy to hash out the debt deal, saw their star power grow throughout negotiations with the White House.  It was the second time this year that McCarthy called on the duo to assist him after the pair helped his climb to the Speakership in January.  After several fruitless meetings with Biden, McCarthy tapped Graves and McHenry — a “policy wonk” and the chair of the Financial Services Committee — to represent Republicans in negotiations with the White House.  The two delivered, breaking the political logjam and agreeing to a deal that won a big majority in the House and in the GOP conference.  In the process, Graves’s and McHenry’s work will foster talk about their own political futures, including whether either could be a House GOP leader or Speaker.  President Biden  © Provided by The Hill President Biden  Biden had to shift from his position that he would not negotiate on the debt ceiling. And he was forced to bow to GOP demands for lower domestic discretionary spending and new work requirements for food stamps, which infuriated liberals.  Yet Biden also emerged as a winner in the negotiations by getting the House GOP to agree to raise the debt ceiling through Jan. 1, 2025, kicking any future showdown beyond the elections next year.  In the end, Biden didn’t have to make any huge concessions. Even on the food stamps issue, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the government could spend more money on nutrition assistance under the deal because of provisions negotiated to increase access for veterans, the homeless and other vulnerable groups.  Biden took some criticism from the left, but a vast majority of the House Democratic caucus voted for the legislation.  In next year’s campaign, Biden will surely use the negotiations to argue that he’s a political leader able to work with Republicans and win bipartisan deals.  Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)  © Provided by The Hill Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)  Manchin for years has been pushing federal regulators to approve the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 303-mile natural gas project that cuts through the heart of Appalachia.  The debt-ceiling deal provides expedited permits allowing final construction of the pipeline to resume.  The provision is a huge victory for Manchin, who faces what’s shaping up to be the toughest reelection contest of his Senate tenure next year, when he’s facing a popular — and wealthy — GOP governor in Jim Justice.  The agreement also includes permitting reforms designed to expedite other energy infrastructure projects around the country, provisions Manchin can also point to next year.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  © Provided by The Hill Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  From the start, McConnell said that he would take a back seat on negotiations to raise the debt limit, insisting that it was a matter to be hashed out between the House and White House.  Many didn’t believe him. But in the end, he got exactly what he wanted.  The Senate GOP leader stayed on the sidelines throughout months of discussions over the borrowing limit, despite the White House trying to pull the Kentucky Republican into negotiations and Democrats hoping he would swoop in and land a debt limit deal with Biden, as the pair did in 2011.  “It was clear from the outset that preserving the full faith and credit of the United States was going to come down to an agreement that could both pass the people’s House and earn the president’s signature,” McConnell said in remarks on the Senate floor Thursday. “In other words, direct negotiations between Speaker McCarthy and President Biden. Just like I’ve said for months.”  LOSERS  The House Freedom Caucus  © Provided by The Hill Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas)  Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus didn’t like the final bill, but they couldn’t stop it.  And in the end, the vote wasn’t even really close.  “I’m trying to figure out exactly what conservatives should be happy about,” Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), a member of the group, said this week.  The bill doesn’t cut spending as much as they wanted, suspends the debt ceiling for almost a year longer than conservatives had hoped, and excludes a long list of policy provisions favored by the GOP, including the repeal of green energy tax credits and an immediate end to Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.  The bill also empowered McCarthy, who has to deal with threats to his continued Speakership from the right, but was able to signal his control over his conference with this week’s vote.  Progressives  © Provided by The Hill Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)  Liberals were also left grousing over the nature of the compromise, which included a long list of policies they oppose and led 46 of them in the House to vote against the legislation when it hit the floor Wednesday. Five Senate liberals also opposed the measure.  The progressives had urged Biden to hold the line in his demand for a “clean” debt ceiling hike, only to see the president come to the table and negotiate a host of cuts and policy changes.  They had opposed any new work requirements for social benefit programs, only to see Democratic leaders agree to new limits on eligibility for low-income food assistance.  They have howled at the notion of easing environmental reviews for energy infrastructure projects, which was included in the package.  And they had urged the president to demand tax hikes, not just spending cuts, as a deficit-reduction strategy — yet another item excluded from the final deal.  “This travesty has proven that we must once and for all reform the debt limit so that the working and poor people of this country can never be taken hostage again,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. <br>\n<br>\n<br><b>*Option 1*</b></br>\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) emerged as the biggest winner of the debt ceiling fight.\nPresident Biden was able to kick the debt ceiling showdown beyond the elections next year.\nSen.
